    "description": "From a former law enforcement park ranger and investigator, this female-driven true crime adventure follows the author\u2019s quest to find missing hikers along the Pacific Crest Trail by pairing up with an eclectic group of unlikely allies.\u00a0As a park ranger with the National Park Service's law enforcement team, Andrea Lankford led search and rescue missions in some of the most beautiful (and dangerous) landscapes across America, from\u00a0Yosemite to the Grand Canyon. But though she had the support of the agency, Andrea grew frustrated with the service's bureaucratic idiosyncrasies, and left the force after twelve years. Two decades later, however, she stumbles across a mystery that pulls her right back where she left - three young men have vanished from the Pacific Crest Trail, the 2,650-mile trek made famous by Cheryl Strayed's Wild , and no one has been able to find them. It\u2019s bugging the hell out of her.\u00a0Andrea\u2019s concern soon leads her to a wild environment unlike any she\u2019s ever ventured into - missing person Facebook groups. Andrea launches an investigation, joining forces with an eclectic team of amateurs who are determined to solve the cases: a mother of the missing, a retired pharmacy manager, and a mapmaker who monitors terrorist activity for the government. Together, they track the activities of kidnappers and murderers, investigate a cult, rescue a psychic in peril, cross paths with an unconventional scientist, and reunite an international fugitive with his family. Searching for the missing is a brutal psychological and physical test with the highest stakes, but eventually their hardships begin to bear strange fruits\u2014ones that lead them to places and people they never saw coming.",

    "description": "White lies. Dark humor. Deadly consequences\u2026 Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn\u2019t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American\u2014in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel. Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena\u2019s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.So when June witnesses Athena\u2019s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena\u2019s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.So what if June edits Athena\u2019s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song\u2014complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn\u2019t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That\u2019s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.But June can\u2019t get away from Athena\u2019s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June\u2019s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang\u2019s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.",

With a mother who spends most of her time in Ghana (yet still somehow manages to be overbearing), Maddie is the primary caretaker for her father, who suffers from advanced stage Parkinson\u2019s. At work, her boss is a nightmare and Maddie is tired of always being the only Black person in every meeting.When her mum returns from her latest trip to Ghana, Maddie leaps at the chance to get out of the family home and finally start living. A self-acknowledged late bloomer, she\u2019s ready to experience some important \u201cfirsts\u201d: She finds a flat share, says yes to after-work drinks, pushes for more recognition in her career, and throws herself into the bewildering world of internet dating.
