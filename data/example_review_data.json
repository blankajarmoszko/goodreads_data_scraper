      "review_text": "Touching and insightful non-fiction book about three men (Chris Sylvia, Kris Fowler, and David O'Sullivan) who went missing on the Pacific Crest Trail and the immense efforts that went into (and still continue) searching for them. Andrea Lankford worked in law enforcement for the National Park service and was involved with many search and rescue operations. She left that job to become a nurse, but when she learned about these missing people, she decided to discover what she could about where they might be and help to bring closure to the families. What occurred after was a journey of knowledge and investigation, which involved a diverse group of people and immense effort.I was engrossed in this book from the beginning. I live very near where the PCT crosses through Washington and have known both through hikers (those who travel the entire PCT from Mexico to Canada) and section hikers, and have provided transportation to those who have skipped a portion of the trail for one reason or another. This connection drew me to the book, but Lankford's writing and the meticulous examination of the cases of the missing hikers, as well as insight into hiker culture and search and rescue operations in general kept me enthralled.Unfortunately, it is still unknown what happened to the three men, but this book brings enlightening awareness and hopefully will lead to their discovery at some point. I hesitate to call this a \"true crime\" book because there is no evidence at all that crimes have been committed, but it reads similarly to a true crime story because there is an overall mystery of what happened to these men. I highly recommend this book to those interested in narrative non-fiction. The Pacific Crest Trail has become more popular (thus more populated) and also more connected via technology in recent years, but it is still a vast wilderness fraught with peril on one hand and incredible beauty and serenity on the other. I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",

      "review_text": "Many people try to hike all 2,650 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, or PCT, each and every year. This route spans from Mexico to Canada on the west coast and includes some of the most beautiful places on Earth. See the dry valleys of California, the serene Crater Lake, and breathe in the cool, clean air of Mount Rainier. (my personal favorite) But what happens to those poor souls who wander off the trail and are lost? Andrea Lankford, a retired parks search and rescue officer, and her pack of amateur sleuths try to put clues together to try and find three lost hikers who attempted the 5-month journey and give the family the peace they have been searching for years.Whether you\u2019re following along with the vivid depictions of trail stops, sights, and or search parameters set forth, the book never fails to be thrilling. The search team dips their toes into many avenues to try and find these missing hikers. This includes contacting mediums, DNA specialists, psychics, crackpot inventors, exploitative adventure seekers, cult followers, and so much more. It gets pretty wild, and the devotion of the family\u2019s search attempts is heartwarming, to say the least.The core of the book follows the search of the main three hikers, but deviates to some other well-known people who have lost their way along the trail and reports on a variety of peskies in the more secluded areas. The story-telling is concise and it does a great job explaining some of the most common hiking terms such as zero-days, HYOH, trail angels, and more. For those seeking to take on a long thru-hike, it is important to read some of these stories and add their knowledge to your trail rolodex. You never know when it might come in handy. I recommended this to all hikers and arm-chair adventurers!\n\ud83d\udcdd | Extra | \ud83d\udcdd\u2019s\n\u2756 A big thank you to Helga, my trailblazing reading buddy.

      "review_text": "NetGalley read. For honest review. I am a day hiker, and a long distance walker myself (Spanish and Portugal Camino) but not a backpacker or thru hiker. Yet I found this a fascinating book and would highly recommend it if you have an interest in wilderness/search and rescue or are a long distance hiker or have an interest in the subject. There is a treasure trove of information here, but it will require some searching and focus on your part. But like a long hike in the nature, it is certainly worth the effort.There was much I loved about this book and a few instances where it drove me crazy. It is well written story by a woman who was a former park ranger and wilderness rescuer/first responder now turned R.N. She has the qualifications and experience needed to really lend a hand and tell a well-developed exploration of how hikers, even good ones and often less than qualified ones, overstep in nature and are lost. This is a story of how three male hikers were lost on the Pacific Coast Trail (the thru hike--2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada brought to life in the book Wild by Cheryl Strayed--later made into the film by the same name) for over 5 years and have not been found.It is easier to say what this story is not about than exactly what it is. It is not a true crime story as it is pitched on the cover and reviews. Not unless we count getting lost as the crime, since death on a hike could possibly be foul play but is more likely to be accidental mishap and injury caused by a wrong choice or a wrong step. I would certainly consider it a Cold Case type mystery. One where others have failed and there is a hope that you might just uncover the key that solves it and brings closures to these families. It does cover a lot of facets about hiking--what to bring to stay safe, a little on the needed preparation, how accidents can happen even for experienced hikers and how difficult finding hikers in the wilderness is.There is lots about the Pacific Coast Trail--how difficult it is, how many more hikers attempt it since its popularity took off after Stayed's book, the different terrains encountered, fewer re-supply stops, why hikers get discouraged and how few make it the full length, even when it is the plan. Grief and closure are discussed throughout as several people who want to help find these men realize how difficult it can be to give up even when their own money, hope and ideas are exhausted, because they have become close with the families.How scattered and uncoordinated search efforts are, no clear responsibility or chain of command of law enforcement efforts, the final responsibility often falling on local police forces who do not have the time, resources or personnel to tackle this kind of search.The meat of the story is about three male hikers of varied experience who have been lost on the trail and never been found. One in 2016, one in 2017 and one in 2018. Two lost in the Mohave desert in California in the early going hiking days and one in the wilds of Washington almost at the finish. Each hiker\u2019s backstory is recounted at length, what is known on why he decided to hike this trail and how far he got, when his disappearance was noted and the immediate rescue efforts. There is much detail on new items of clothing found and investigation of trails that might have been taken in error.A variety of people, mostly amateurs aside from Lankford get involved with these cases and they enlist a variety of efforts to make headway where little has been made before. They do have the information on what has been done previously. But there is surprisingly little aside from the areas search and the last know whereabouts of these hikers. A group evolves to lend time and what expertise they have to help. This includes psychics, professional internet map searchers, previous law enforcement people, improbable inventors, and drone experts. All avenues are explored, including improbable trails taken, possible mountain lion and rattle snake encounters, criminal encounters, suicide and purposefully going off and not wanting to be found. It was fascinating but at times difficult to follow especially on audio. Two of the lost have the name Chris, and though they are lost on different parts of the trail, descriptions of wilderness are often similar so there were times I was not exactly sure where I was and exactly which of the hikers was being talked about. Timelines were often non-liner, as different searchers came into the story and different aspects of the search for each hiker was discussed there, dates and time jump back and forward in the story telling. Not sure how this could have been avoided but it did not make it any easier to follow. It is a non-fiction story telling but I hesitate to call it a narrative, it is more informational and mostly well done. There is much information here on a fascinating subject. The audio was read by Kristi Burns and she did a very good narration. I used both the audio and the print advanced reader copy in my reading. I did not find one better than the other. It did demand focus from me so I was glad to have both on hand, there are great maps of the trail in the book and they are helpful to clarify events and time lines. Thanks to NetGalley for the print Advanced Reader Copyp.s I listened and read while day hiking in Estonia and Finland. What hidden gems these beautiful places are in the Fall!",

      "review_text": "What a disappointment this was. Besides being poorly organized and hard to follow, it felt like the author was grasping at straws to create enough content for this book. Some parts were absolutely infuriating - specifically, when the author ignored her misgivings about the scam doctor's \"DNA detector\" and hired him anyway, giving a grieving mother false hope. Maybe that's \"investigative journalism,\" but to me it sounds a lot like idiocy. She even acknowledges the idea that they might be doing more harm than good, but then chooses an alternative interpretation of their actions.Don't even get me started on the psychic or the interpretation of targeted Facebook ads in looking for \"signs.\"I listened to the audiobook and shuddered every time the reader pronounced \"San Jacinto.\"",

      "review_text": "The premise of a former national park ranger with expertise in search and rescue tackling the cases of three hikers who disappeared from the Pacific Crest Trail in 2015-17 caught my eye. I'm not a hiker, nor an outdoorsperson of any kind really, so I was looking\u00a0forward to dipping into a world I know basically nothing about, with the true crime hook. Indeed, the book really seems to be of a larger cultural moment where armchair sleuthing has boomed via countless podcasts, shows, and endless books. For the most part, the book eschews any real\u00a0examination of why she, and some of the other searchers she teams up with are keen to spend so much time, energy, and money, putting themselves in danger, trying to track down these people they have no personal connection to.\u00a0It starts off promisingly, as the author explains her time with the National Park Service and establishes\u00a0her credentials as an expert in wilderness search and rescue. I actually could have used more on her time as a ranger -- which I later realized was probably all in her first book, Ranger Confidential. She then introduces the cases of three young men who were last seen on the Pacific Crest Trail (which runs more than 2,500 miles from Canada\u00a0to Mexico), and covers some quite treacherous terrain. After the first third of the book, which sets things up, including the history of the trail, it all starts to get a little choppy and confusing.To be sure, the reader gets a really good picture of the subculture of \"thru hikers\" (hikers trying to do the entire length of the trail), and the various support networks around the trail, especially the volunteer \"trail angels\" who maintain shelters and provide support. However, the actual \"relentless search\" is often confusing to follow, as she hops between the three missing, various timelines, various locations, and various partners in searching. There are discrete patches that are quite interesting, for example an attempt to use aerial photography and volunteers who pore over the results. The detective work of chasing down people who may or may not have seen the missing, working out clues from photos and Facebook posts -- that's all classic amateur sleuthing\u00a0stuff that's pretty well done.\u00a0But this is undermined by the indulgence in crackpot stuff, such as repeated use of a psychic, and especially a clearly crackpot (and expensive) scam involving an absurd DNA detector. And while I hesitate to say too much -- readers who crave resolution from their non-fiction narratives may want to think twice before starting down this book's trail. By the end, the choppiness of the narrative had really taken its toll, and I'm not sure I'd recommend. Readers who are avid hikers will probably find this pretty interesting, but as a true crime book, it doesn't really hold together.",

      "review_text": "This is the third book about the search for people lost in the American wilderness that I\u2019ve read in the past few years. I guess I need to add a GR shelf, since this is a topic that is clearly of interest to me.Some themes recur in all of the books (\"stay on the f*ing trail\"), but each has a specific focus. In this one, Andrea Lankford recounts the efforts to find three young-ish men (from my perspective, someone in their 30's is classifiable as young but perhaps this is not accurate) who disappeared along the Pacific Crest Trail in three successive years. At 2,600+ miles, the PCT offers a lot of territory in which to get lost. Once a through-hiking route favored primarily by committed, experienced hikers, it has become popular with people more enthusiastic than skilled since the publication of Cheryl Strayed's Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail. Most people who are lost along the trail are eventually accounted for one way or another; the fact that these men have not been makes their stories stand out.But this book isn't just about the men or the trail, or even the family members who are unable to properly mourn since there is no explanation for what happened. Much of the focus is on the people, primarily women, who were determined to find answers to these disappearances and devoted significant portions of their lives to the process. The searchers. Their sacrifices also translate to personal growth.As always in a book of this type, there is a lot of fascinating information about history, and nature, and even technology. For instance, I've decided that if I ever have reason to travel through Idyllwild, CA, I'm not getting out of the car. The Idyllwild rattlesnake is one of the deadliest in the US, with venom loaded with neurotoxins. And although it's definitely a critter to watch out for on the PCT, it's also found in homes and backyards and parks in the area. Lankford writes about two technologies recently having gained attention among those searching for the lost. One appears to be nothing more than a \"scientifically proven\" hoax, while the other, the use of very high resolution photos taken by drones, has been demonstrated to be effective.There are so many reasons a young man (I'm sticking with this term) might vanish in the wilderness. He could have strayed from the trail and become lost. He might have been attacked by one of those rattlers, or a cougar, or a grizzly up near the Canadian border. (Lankford argues that the black bears along the PCT are pretty laid back. Hmm...) He might have put himself in a risky position in order to get a really great selfie, and fallen down a cliffside. He might intentionally have gone off-trail in an effort to distance himself from society in pursuit of self-discovery and not been able to get back when he wanted to. He might have become involved with a cult, at least one of which is known to befriend PCT hikers and convince them to break ties with their families. Or he may have been a victim of violence at the hands of another hiker. Although Lankford acknowledges this possibility, she makes another distinction between the Appalachian Trail (where the bears are less Zen) and the PCT: there has never been a documented murder along the PCT. Sadly, this is not the case with the AT.One last observation from the book. The reason fewer women than men go missing in the wilderness is not simply because fewer women venture into the wilderness. Women are more on guard, with more highly developed self-preservation instincts. They trust less and take fewer risks. And me - I always stick to the trail, but I will keep on hiking.",

I've lived in Washington my whole life and had never heard of the PCT somehow, and hearing places I've been to multiple times on vacation mentioned as base camps for searchers was wildly interesting. Lankford did a fine job balancing personal experience and opinion, science and statistics, and covering multiple cases progressing around the same time period. I was impressed at her composed discussion of the more colorful aspects of such cases - trail weirdos, facebook trolls, wannabe helpful psychics, and other hikers who chimed in with distracting, false sightings and leads. She also kept it fact-focused, something I found missing in Jon Billman's similar book, The Cold Vanish, where he meandered off about Bigfoot and conspiracy theories.",

A park-ranger-turned-nurse, she got involved in one of the unofficial searches almost by accident, but once she was in, she couldn't turn away.I read Lankford's Ranger Confidential in 2016, and it left me with the sense that she had loved her work but was deeply burnt out by the time she left. This proved to be a better fit of a book for me, partly because I adore both thru-hiking books and search-and-rescue memoir, but also because Lankford is uniquely qualified to write it. Lankford more than had the qualifications to take part in the search efforts, and she proves here that she also has the research and writing skills to weave a very complicated story. This is three stories in one, mixed with numerous others\u2014because inevitably, over the course of years of searching and researching, Lankford and the scrappy team of searchers she was involved with stumbled across, or were asked to investigate, other missing-persons cases. No spoilers, but what the investigations turned up varied widely.Most missing-person cases in the wild are resolved quickly, but that was not to be the case for any of these three. It makes for a twisty and turny ride, with leads including a cult, multiple psychics, questionable science (read: the kind of science that the book is here to critique, not to promote), drone footage, solo accidents, accidents involving other people, and much more.One thing that might turn some readers off: Lankford has a tendency of mentioning mental illness in the context of crime (\"...a thirty-two year-old man with a history of mental illness...\" (loc. 3148*); \"...mentally ill fugitive...\" (loc. 3638); \"...attacked by a mentally deranged man\" (loc. 4539); etc.). It's never a main point of the story, but then, neither is any of these individuals' mental health relevant to whatever parts of the story Lankford tells. Again, not a big enough part of the story for me to draw conclusions, but enough to mention...and to remind anyone who is still reading that people with mental illness are far more likely to be victims of violent crimes than to commit them themselves.Overall, a fast and gripping read if you're drawn to wild spaces, mysteries, and stories taking place in the intersection of those things. May be of interest to readers of Kathryn Miles' Trailed and Jon Billman's The Cold Vanish.Thanks to the author and publisher for providing a review copy through NetGalley.*I read an ARC, and quotes may not be final.",

This lacked focus, and was doing circles and retracing steps. This book is supposed to be about three Pacific Crest Trail hikers: two that were missing in the San Jacincto Mountain range, and one other person, in Washington, almost ready to complete his journey. So we have three narratives, right? Well, it starts out OK, with the author explaining their stories and their persona before they got lost. That is good for about one hundred pages. After that, the book goes into detours, loop de loops, and my head was spinning from all the unsavory characters the author introduces, which have little or no impact on the crux of the story, which I am still trying to figure out. I thought this book was going to be straightforward: maybe some twists, some leads, false hopes, then leading to finding at least ONE hiker? Not the case. While this is well-meaning, it is basically a rambling journal article. This was labeled by the publisher on the book sleeve that this was a \"true crime thriller\". The true crime is that I spent many hours slogging through nonsensical drivel about all these unconnected characters. I fell asleep more than once reading this tripe. Do yourself a favor and read \"Where You'll Find Me\" by Ty Gagne, or any of his other books. He knows how to write a story tragedy in the mountains and search and rescue.",

You could tell Ms. Lankford is passionate and enthusiastic about her second and helping families find their missing loved ones. One thing I liked very much was learning all about the thru-hikers and their codes and ways. I had no idea they were so interconnected and there were so many 'trail angels' willing to help with a bite to eat, a place to stay or just companionship. That in itself would make a fantastic book. I just wish I could have kept track of all of the Characters in the tale",

      "review_text": "\"And one more thing, call your mom.\"I've been follow the story of Sherpa for years. I joined the FB group long ago, since I'm from the PNW, and my heart always broke when his mom would post something and follow up with a request for a phone call. I first heard about David O'Sullivan's story while watching the show Disappeared. I was floored because, again, it involved the PCT and he was so early in his trek before he vanished. Sadly, I'd never heard of Chris Sylvia until I cracked this book.It always blows me away when people disappear. I feel like I'm in thousands of random photos in the background, oblivious, or in some type of CCTV footage daily. But something like the PCT is the perfect place for someone to disappear. And that makes these stories compelling. I grabbed this for the cover and title but stayed for the well-told, heart-wrenching stories. The behind-the-scenes peek into SAR searches, drone views, the squinters, and the long hikes were jaw-dropping but also inspiring. Even knowing the up-to-date info on at least 2 of the stories, I was completely drawn into the humanity and love in this story. I can't imagine the heartache of the not knowing so learning all they have done to try to find them was astounding and amazing. This is well written and hooked me from the first page. I hope Andrea Lankford keeps telling us stories, I'll definitely keep reading them!A huge thank you to the author and publisher for providing an e-ARC via Netgalley. This does not affect my opinion regarding the book.",

I was not disappointed. This non-fiction novel focuses on three missing person cases on the PCT. All three went missing around the same time, one after the other, but each case was unique.

      "review_text": "A haunting read that will stay with you. This book had me hooked from the very first page, I could not put it down. The writing flows easily across the pages. As a former NPS ranger with many years of SAR (Search & Rescue) under her belt, Andrea Lankford finds herself drawn to the disappearance of three men on the PCT over a three year interval. As her curiosity grows, we embark with her on her journey to figure out what happened to these men. Many people join in on the search, including the families who have been searching from the start. As the book progress you get invested in these stories, in these three men. What happened to them? Where are they? Lankford plunges you into hiking culture and brings you on a trip from the PNW to the Mexican border to find these missing hikers. She does not shy away from details of the investigation, searches and how brutal it is for the families having to live through this. Trail lingo is used in the book, which is explained by the author, for those not familiar with it.As the author states, this book is also a cautionary tale. A cautionary tale to all hikers or want to be hikers: Nature can be unforgiving, no matter how experienced you are. As most experienced hikers know, magnificent beauty can come at a great price. This book is a stark reminder of that. Having hiked the West Coast Trail and in Walbran valley I know how challenging and utterly terrifying things like storms, wild animals (cougars) and shady people can be at times for hikers.This is a great book, I highly recommend it for those who enjoy reading mysteries or about the great outdoor. I received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",

I was hooked on the reading and stayed up until 03:00 in the morning on one occasion to read on. I think this appealed to me as I have no intention of entering the Great American Wilderness and have no shame in saying that I can live vicariously through those who do. Those who go missing in that pursuit are another kettle of fish altogether. What fate befell them? Did they want to disappear away from humanity? Were they the victim of human crime or animal attack? Or were they just unlucky and succumb to bad weather/unstable rock/a misstep from the path? I thoroughly enjoyed this read, I was completely captivated from start to finish. I definitely intend to re-read. Brilliant 5 star read.",

      "review_text": "If I were rating this purely on writing quality, I'd have to bump it up another star or two. I spent so much of the book irritated and ranting about idiocy and lack of understanding of basic scientific and statistical principles that the compelling narrative was the only reason I didn't give up in the first few pages.However, writing quality is not the only quality on which to rate a book. Particularly not when that book is non-fiction. And on every other possible assessment of non-fiction, Lankford should be absolutely ashamed of herself.To start, there are very simple, highly probable answers to each of the \"mysteries\" of the missing hikers she profiles. They got injured, lost, or both. Possibly they had an accident with one or more of the many hazards on the trail. O'Sullivan almost certainly got turned around, ran out of water, and died of heat exhaustion and dehydration somewhere in the brush. Alternatively, he might have slipped and fell down a ravine somewhere. Fowler entered the Cascades during extreme poor weather and likely died of hypothermia, exposure, drowning, or a fall. Their bodies haven't been found because the PCT covers a vast swathe of wilderness, the majority of which an experienced searcher who properly understands the risks of the trail knows better than to enter. Sylvia is the only one with even a sliver of a chance to have simply decided to run off with a cult or go off-grid, but even he most likely simply got lost and/or injured, ran out of water, and died of dehydration or heat exhaustion.That Lankford not only insists on believing otherwise, thereby prolonging the suffering of the families involved, but profited by writing a book that treats the disappearances like entertainment is inhumane to the point of cruelty. I had hoped for something with the journalistic quality of Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster or the scholarship and compassion of They Leave Their Kidneys in the Fields: Illness, Injury, and Illegality among U.S. Farmworkers (California Series in Public Anthropology). Instead, Lankford wrote a lurid, paranoid account of completely improbable \"possibilities\" designed to entice the armchair sleuthing crowd that insists on believing everything is a conspiracy.It doesn't help that Lankford gets some of the most basic of facts wrong. A PCT hiker will not cross the borders of three countries. They will cross exactly one border: that between the US and Canada. The trail starts on the US side of the border with Mexico. There is no crossing at that point. It is impractical for a hiker to even try. To anyone with experience on the PCT, the mistakes are enough to remove all credibility from anything else Lankford writes.Here is the sad truth: hikers go missing due to natural hazards, arrogance, inexperience, and lack of preparedness. They stay missing because the terrain is so inhospitable that to conduct a search of every inch--or even every square mile--is impossible. As more and more inexperienced hikers insist on treating a backcountry trail like a walk in their local park, the number of those missing will increase. There is no mystery. There is certainly no conspiracy. Only a painful reality that everyone considering undertaking a 2,650 mile trek should understand before ever putting together their first gear list.",

Andrea Lankford, a former cop and park ranger, has gone on many different search and rescue missions and there is nothing worse than not being able to bring home a missing person. The Pacific Crest Trail is over 2,600 miles long and is not for the faint of heart. Cheryl Strayed popularized the route after her memoir, Wild, became an international bestseller. An experienced searcher and hiker herself; Andrea finds herself drawn to three missing person cases of hikers gone missing on the PCT trail. Together with their mothers and a tenacious searcher named Cathy they spend years of their life, sanity, and resources combing the wilderness and following up leads. Heartfelt, educational, and ultimately hopeful; rather than dissuading hikers from attempting the trek, this story still makes the route beautiful while putting on strong cautions and safety warnings for it. Wonderful writing.",

      "review_text": "The Pacific Crest Trail is one of the longest and toughest in the world - and one of the most famous, thanks in part to the best-selling book and the movie Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail. Every year, many people, known as thru-hikers, attempt to walk all 2,650 miles. But it is as challenging and dangerous as it is beautiful, and sometimes these attempts end badly. The author of this book recounts such cases, describing the search for three young men who disappeared there without a trace.I have to admit that I chose this book to learn more about the PCT itself, expecting the lost person cases to be a starting point for a travel or nature book, just as the Saasquach is just a pretext for telling a deeper story in the wonderful In the Valleys of the Noble Beyond: In Search of the Sasquatch. However, while there is some background information, this is more of a classic true crime story - both gripping and frustrating as you root for a bunch of amateur searchers trying to help grieving families find out what happened to their loved ones. I was a little confused as to why someone would give up so much of their time, energy, and even health for a seemingly lost cause, but I suppose it can become a kind of fixation. I was also a little uncomfortable reading about psychics and fraudsters being treated as possible sources of relevant information. Nevertheless, it is a well-told, gripping story and I am sure true crime fans will find it compelling.Thanks to the publisher, Hachette Books, and NetGalley for an advanced copy of this book.",

Instead, the only resolution we're offered is the author's sidetracks into stories of missing hikers that are solved. I probably would have liked the book more if it had been marketed as the story of SEVERAL lost hikers so I didn't spend the entire time wondering when something would finally happen only to be annoyed at the end because I felt like my time had been wasted by three fruitless searches. Also, there's a strange disconnect between the way Arpad Vass's scam was portrayed and how the \"psychic\" was presented.

      "review_text": "3 \u2b50 This felt like a reread, and not the good kind. I love Scarlett St. Clair's take on Hades x Persephone. I have for years now. But the whole point of the Hades Saga was supposed to be about uncovering secrets, hearing and knowing what can only be learned from Hades' perspective on a story we already know. This book, though, told the same story with some sprinkling of other details, and since  A Touch of Malice  was my least favourite book on the H&P series, I guess it's only fitting that this would be my least favourite in Hades Saga. The most interesting parts of this book were Dionysus' chapters, without a doubt. His and Ariadne's adventures, their ups and downs, truly carried this book through. Theseus' chapters were exactly what I know they were supposed to be, but they were still hard to read. I think having the villain's POV in a book can be eye opening, but in this case it was just kind of gross, tbh. He is a foul person and being inside his narrative felt repulsive, which I guess means it was perfect? Idk. I was equally as frustrated with Hades in this book as I was with his character during most of A Touch of Malice. Every single problem that felt like a miscommunication issue is proven to be just that. It's always Hades hiding vital information and being a controlling, disrespectful as* to his fiancee. Also, this is very much a 'sex fixes everything' kind of story, so reader discretion is advised. I generally don't have a problem with it, but even I felt like it was too much here. The smut is not great, and I don't think the MCs held a single conversation with one another. In the entire book. Again, one of my issues with ATOM. I don't think there is a chance to spoil anything about this book, since it's literally just a retelling of a different book in the other MCs POV, but I will refrain from talking about important plot-lines or moments. Just know that the cliffhanger is equally as underwhelming and frustrating as it was in ATOM . This is the third instalment in this series, and the sixth book this author has written about this story. As someone who has read all of them, I would recommend maybe skipping this one unless you really want to read a handful of interesting chapters about Dionysus and Ariadne. After reading it, I don't think I have any new information or hold any insight as to what  A Touch of Chaos may look like. I will say, though, that my complains about this book are just about the same as they were with  A Touch of Malice , so if you loved that book, then you'll really enjoy this one. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50/ 5 \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f.5 / 5------------OMFG I got this ARC! What!? I'm so f*cking excited! I added this book to Want to Read in February 2021, and now I have an ARC!? I'm speechless. I might cry. This is a big deal! (To me lol) I'm writing it here because my family and friends are not as excitable as I am when great book related things happen to me, so at this point I don't even bring these things up to them \u2013 but OMG I'M SO HAPPY!!!!!",

      "review_text": "2.75 stars. Hades povs have always been interesting. He's ancient, God of the Dead, a hopeless romantic. His books have always brought something new, expanding the world, adding even more substance to the plot and characters. I don't know what happened with this one. Actually, I do. There was more overlapping content than his previous povs, so it felt more repetitive. You might think being introduced to new povs, like Dionysus, would help keep things fresh. It didn't. I found his character, though interesting in theory, SO tedious. His pov was largely just him being horny for Ariadne, and I just didn't CARE. For 6 books, this story has been about HadesxPersephone. Now, in the penultimate book, I'm supposed to be invested in characters I don't know, and how badly they want to bang each other?! Almost every interaction boiled down to how hard she made him. There's already a lot of smut via Hades. It's one thing to introduce new characters towards the end of a series, but tell me how reading about Dionysus masturbating adds context? Or furthers the plot? Or the HadesxPersephone love story?! We also got Theseus pov. Interesting villain. Sadistic. But he's also got a hard-on for Ariadne. And Helen. And Persephone. Multiple hard-ons. Erections everywhere. More pointless smut. It was tiresome and repetitive and I only got through it because I started skimming. There's romantic moments in this, some beautiful writing, important themes are explored, the research is excellent and Hecate's character, as always, is a highlight. Maybe I wasn't in the mood? Maybe picking this up after ToG Queen of Shadows was a mistake? Maybe after 6 books, I'm less willing to overlook the fact that Hades would solve 90% of his problems if he just had a conversation with Persephone?! This didn't hit like they usually do, and actually, I am less excited now about picking up the final book, though I am looking forward to seeing the series wrap.",

With their wedding on the horizon, the couple should be ecstatic. But Demeter is wreaking havoc on their bliss by battering the whole of New Greece with erratic and dangerous weather. At the same time, Theseus continues with his agenda against the Gods, allying with the hate-group Triad in an effort to bring down all of Olympus.Hades refuses to allow anything to stop him from securing Persephone as his bride, but he must play a deep strategic game with the Gods of Olympus to safeguard their future. And it is not entirely clear which Gods are truly on his side.MY THOUGHTS:There was a lot of wonderful spicy scenes but the chemistry between Hades and Persephone is so profound it just worked. Much like anyone\u2019s relationship that is still relatively new, it was abundant and spaced well throughout the book. I\u2019m anxious to read the next books in the series of Persephone\u2019s point of view and Hades as well. Theseus needs to be taken down. I really want Hades and Persephone to have a baby. Fates, Zeus and Hera be damned!!",

Book 2: Game of Retribution kept me up at 2 a.m., yet this was . . . just meh.I felt the chapters of Ariadne and Dionysus did not contribute to the main storyline or move the plot forward. This has always been Hades's story - and now we were introduced to multiple POVs: Hades, Dionysus and Theseus - the antagonist . . .Honestly, I did not care why he was doing what he was doing or how - who cares? As long as the plot was good - even if only Hade's POV was present - then this would have felt different.Still 3 stars - was still okay just took me longer to read.",

I definitely can\u2019t remember what it was that captured my interest enough to consider these 6 books must-reads. I\u2019ve consistently rated Persephone\u2019s books 3 star because I find her to be quite frankly insufferable as a FMC. I\u2019ve consistently rated Hades books 4 stars mainly because they\u2019re better than hers and also because they tend to have more of the Greek mythology.In this one, I enjoyed Dionysus and Ariadne\u2019s scenes. I also liked the end? The last chapter or two of this was compelling from Hades POV and the rest I could have honestly lived without, I feel like it should have been included in Persephone\u2019s book. There wasn\u2019t enough of a fresh perspective or any hidden secrets coming from Hades to justify his own book rehashing the same stale story without adding anything. The 7th book is the final one and I want the closure that reading it will bring but I\u2019m so not excited for it if this is anything to go by. Am I well? Well and truly tired \ud83d\ude14",

Sorry not sorry but this was so fucking boring I can't even??? I feel like I have a lot of thoughts on this book so get comfortable lmao. The only reason I didn't DNF this is because ATOC is the last book and I'm reading that for CLOSURE. if you liked this book, do not read this lmaoI know some people were living for the Dionysus POVs and ik Scarlett said she included them because it gives context for A Touch of Chaos but I could not find it to care even a little bit about what Dionysus and Ariadne were doing because it just felt like it was breaking up the flow of the story. It was like being locked into a YT vid and then there's an unskippable ad. Dionysus' POVs would've landed much better for me if Scarlett had just written a novella that goes between this book and ATOC because I just couldn't make myself CARE; I didn't pick up this book to read about what Dionysus was doing, I want to know about Hades I really struggled with the 3rd person in this one. By 5% I was like this is boring af and it felt like the story was being recounted to me as oppose to being told. I enjoyed AGOF and AGOR because Hades was off living a completely different life and this just felt like the exact same book as ATOM and that was disappointing because I really enjoyed AGOR. In general, i feel like authors take a massive gamble when their books are spread across 3+ years because so much about a reader and their reading experience may change that your book may not land the way it could\u2019ve if read in immediate succession. I remember really loving these books c.2021 but they\u2019re just not hitting the same anymore which may just be a me problem but I'm so annoyed that this isn't hitting the way it used to for me Persephone and Hades are defo a sex solves all couple and while I enjoy the smuttiest of the smuts and I'm literally a smut enthusiast, I do also feel like Scarlett is ruining her story with how much Persephone and Hades, fated mates, have sex instead of communicating like adults, both literal gods with one that has been alive for fuck knows how long. Their relationship felt very transactional and it was weird given how much they claim to love each other. I felt like I had the same problem with Queen of Myth and Monsters because I loved KBB when it came out but between that and QMM, the smut really diluted what could have been a good plot. In this series, you can tell Scarlett has really done her research with Greek Mythology but all of that was diluted for me with the rest of the bs in this book and I feel like she didn't do her characters justice. Like this isn't meant to be erotica and a lot of the times it feels like the smut scenes didn't acc fit, it\u2019s weird and repetitive and takes away from the plot.The best part of this book were the scenes with all the Olympians and even that wasn't anything different from ATOMSidenote, Hera is a bitch and literally stands for nothing and Ariadne is just dumb???Scale:\u2b50\ufe0f - would've DNF'ed / continued out of spite\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f - shit, but whatever\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f - meh, could've been better\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f - lit \ud83d\udc45\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f - loved it, inject this shit into my veins \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\uded1 - no smut\ud83c\udf36 - no point\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36 - mediocre at best\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36 - standard smut, hot\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36 - \ud83e\udd75 okay, some CW\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36\ud83c\udf36 - fuck me \ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75 CWs / filthy with a side of filth - see Poison / Room Twenty-Two: Hide and Seek",

Once again I am left speechless over the magic that is Scarlett St Clair\u2019s writing\u2026 I may go as far as to say this is my favorite Scarlett St Clair book to date. The depth of characters and world building we get just adds a whole different layer to Hades & Persephone\u2019s story. I fell in love with getting multi POVs & need so much more from Dionysus & Ariadne - as in I need an entire series of them!

I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed the Persephone books & the other books in the Hades saga - but this one felt slightly too long - maybe this was also because, like all the Hades plots, it is the same as the Persephone one and he was much more present in the last Persephone book so a lot of this was already known to some extend - and as much as I liked Dionysus & Ariadne it felt like their stuff could be a spinoff novella and didn't need to be included in this book at all, and their inclusion just made this book feel a little crowded? I will say that I am very excited to get to a touch of chaos now as we'll get Hades & Persephone's perspectives together. Also fuck that  wedding scene from Hades's POV was adorable I squeeked.",

      "review_text": "2.5/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn\u2019t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews\u2014ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i\u2019ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that\u2019s not in the premise, anyway), but i\u2019m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won\u2019t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the \u2018extended\u2019 (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do. yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it\u2019s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who\u2019s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn\u2019t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i\u2019m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can\u2019t figure out whether it\u2019s in a \u201cthis didn't work for me, personally\u201d way, or a more objective \u201cthis is a Critique\u201d way. my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk\u2019s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk\u2019s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad\u2014she\u2019s an author who\u2019s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it\u2019s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can\u2019t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don\u2019t actually know what they\u2019re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they\u2019ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc. this may not bother other readers, but i can\u2019t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces\u2014that\u2019s another thing about yellowface, by the way. so many mouthpieces. i don\u2019t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk\u2019s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i\u2019m not fond of them all the time.as always, it\u2019s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it\u2019s veryyy meta\u2014sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it\u2019s too \u2018high concept\u2019 for me, sorry, or maybe it's heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk's narrative choices and plot points and the response would be \u2018well, rin is an unreliable narrator!\u2019 yes, but there is such thing as framing and context which are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is\u2026 a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she's not hindered by rfk's blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie, when it was more about actual people than rfk's comemntary. despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people\u2019s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrative is juniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there's a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn\u2019t put yellowface down. it's insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it\u2019s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that\u2019s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was, \u2018\u2026that\u2019s it?\u2019 i know i said i wouldn\u2019t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says, \u2018I\u2019ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there\u2019s no clear resolution?\u2019 Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that\u2019s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that\u2019ll be for 2023, for when it's no doubt on all the 'Very Important Books of the Year' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don\u2019t see myself rereading yellowface. it's now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she's too attached to athena's image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, 'soft' ending at the end of this. but then the 'crash-and-burn' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere. oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena's fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:  \"Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.\"  but what happens after? we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it's just such a nothing ending. sure, it's #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it's not an emotional resolution, and it's not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don\u2019t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we've seen the cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it's a good example of what i've been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it's trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just \"and this will continue, because doesn't it always continue? isn't this ending so clever?\" the worst part is that it teases you with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of 'accidentally' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she's a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june's complete downward spiral, because at least Athena's death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the \u201cthey always get away with it\u201d message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it's hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i've read, juniper song doesn't burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that's disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assault edit 24/05/2023:  unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1) i am not white. i am asian,  2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) \"[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc.\" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that's just how having an opinion works. i don't know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn't as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i \"missed the point\" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i'm intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it\u2014that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it\u2014padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can\u2019t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can\u2019t deliver. target audience acquired. in line with the theme of the book, i\u2019m going to completely steal another reviewer\u2019s words that i can\u2019t stop thinking about. 'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.' go read it. and i\u2019d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don\u2019t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you\u2019re still hungry. and to be clear, this isn't a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i've had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author's identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn't even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.",

      "review_text": "\u2018Don\u2019t ghosts just want to be remembered?\u2019A book about fucking around and finding out.The question of who should or shouldn\u2019t tell a story has been a hotly debated subject, a discourse that must also recognize the playing field is guided by rules of capitalism in a for-profit publishing industry and a social climate that prods \u201cculture wars\u201d to increase clicks. Still in recent memory are the debates over American Dirt, which sparked months of controversy over white authors using another\u2019s cultural narrative as what many considered \u201ctrauma porn,\u201d but also over the publisher\u2019s decision to throw incredible amounts of marketing money at this book when immigration stories by authors living within the culture were being passed over for that novel. R.F. Kuang\u2019s Yellowface sinks its teeth into the world of publishing and the discourses on authenticity through the eyes of June Hayward, a white woman who has taken the draft of a Chinese-American woman\u2019s novel and published it as her own. She will forever be haunted by this choice, like a Lady Macbeth of letters haunted by bloodstains in her attempt to usurp the kingdom. It is a perfect follow-up to Babel and the conversations on how language can be a form of colonialism, though this one has no magical elements like the former. Instead, Yellowface reads like a scandal unfolding before your eyes and transfixes the reader with all the sick satisfactions that keep us scrolling through social media debates and keep hot takes. Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort, through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator, and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matter. With a sharp critique on the commodification and consumption of art in publishing and reviewing (even Goodreaders are not spared here), a look at online debates, the self-aggrandizing aspects of social media, and the way artists are pitted against each other as if writing was a competitive sport, Kuang\u2019s Yellowface asks big questions on authenticity and identity in a society that has reduced the concepts into marketing metrics.I\u2019ll be honest, I read this book in a single sitting. I could not look away, and Kuang\u2019s writing sweeps you up in it\u2019s conversational cadance. While I\u2019ve enjoyed Kuang\u2019s writing previously, Yellowface feels very polished and matured, the novel reading with the ease and eagerness of a tell-all memoir, which is the framing of the story. As a fictional memoir, it drops a lot of pop culture references to key into a specific time. Kuang\u2019s choice of perspective through June\u2014who rebrands at the request of her publisher as Juniper Song, Song being her middle-name but also nudges readers to think she may have Chinese heritage\u2014is brilliant as it allows us to feel the floor-dropping-out discomfort of becoming the focus of internet rage as well as navigate a vigorous criticism of the publishing industry. Kuang is able to cover issues without moralizing, making the reader sift through alternating opinions that are likely to expose their own assumptions and discomforts, and we must always remember the telling is often guiding us away from judging her and towards everyone else. With a big confession at the center, June can manipulate the reader on smaller issues and in a way it becomes a rather metafictional approach to the way storytelling is just that: fictionalizing stories. Kuang does well by creating a character that isn\u2019t entirely unsympathetic\u2014we need to want to keep reading her take on the events\u2014and hate reading is a shallow effect that evaporates quickly. Not unlike the social media scandals that hit viciously and are forgotten days later. Not that June is innocent, and being disgusted with her is half the fun, but Kuang will force us to consider what exactly it is that disgusts us and what that means in a larger context about art and the commodification of it. We\u2019ve seen these sorts of scandals, such as a personal favorite bizarre tale of Natalie Beach who wrote about being the ghostwriter for Caroline Calloway, or last year\u2019s Who Is the Bad Art Friend? article concerning Sonya Larson and Dawn Dorland where everyone seemed to be too thrilled by the mess to not pick a side. Though the story that seems closest to Yellowface is the one surrounding Kristen Roupenian\u2019s short story Cat Person (you can read it here) which was defended then later attacked when an article revealing the details was taken from a strangers real life, told to the author by the man who was fictionalized in the story as the sex pest and later committed suicide in real life. Twitter was full of well-known authors debating if personal details and stories of others are always fair game, even though the hometown and place of employment of the girl was not changed for the published version (my college roommate later rented the house Roupenian had previously lived in and describes in story). Literary twitter was confronted with a situation about what level of authenticity is appropriate and can someone tell someone else\u2019s story. The way social media fuels a fire is at the heart of this story, with twitter challenging authenticity and morals at all times. Which becomes a tragic interplay at the way authors are demanded to be vulnerable, to seek authenticity and expose their pain for book sales, yet social media loves to exploit personal details and use vulnerabilities as an opening for an attack. \u2018dozen, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands of strangers are out there, mining your personal information, worming their ways into your life, looking for ways to mock, humiliate, or worse, endanger you. You come to regret everything you\u2019ve ever shared about yourself\u2026because the trolls will find them.\u2019We\u2019ve all most likely criticized a stranger on social media, sometimes the pile-ups are too fun and humorous to not get a joke in, but Kuang tries to remind us that the targets are real people with real feelings. Sure, June deserves to be exposed and feel bad for what she\u2019s done, but Kuang puts us in her shoes and lets you feel what being a target is like. Because it can come for anyone, even Athena was once the target of harassment, death threats and hacking where she didn\u2019t feel safe all for being called a \u2018race traitor\u2019 for dating a white man. \u2018In destroying her,\u2019 June narrates the voice of social media, \u2018we create an audience we create moral authority for ourselves.\u2019 Such is the nature of social media in the state of a scandal, and all for what? \u2018 Allegations get flung left and right, everyone\u2019s reputations are torn down, and when the dust clears, everything remains exactly as it was.\u2019 Nothing changes, but, as we see in the novel, much of this is because someone profits from it. A scandal often turns into book sales (for all the complaints American Dirt was canceled it still remained a bestseller for months) and if you keep selling books you keep getting published. \u2018The living are burdened with bodies. They make shadows, footprints.\u2019But lets move to the scandal at hand. Here we have June, who has a tepid friendship with rising literary star Athena Liu. She feels jealous as well as annoyance with Athena, fantasizing how she\u2019d like to \u2018 neatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over myself,\u2019 something she is soon metaphorically doing when she edits the now deceased Athena\u2019s manuscript: a WW1 novel about Chinese laborers. It starts off innocently enough (or so June claims) being an exercise in editing that she gets so caught up in loving writing again that she passes it off as herself. It is titled The Last Front, is praised for a mosaic storytelling style reminiscent of the film Dunkirk and becomes an instant bestseller. She will spend the novel fiercely defending she has the right to tell this story\u2014sometimes being rewarded such as when speaking at a Chinese American Social Club she is thanked by a man who\u2019s Chinese father fought in the war for making sure their stories are told\u2014yet at the end of the day, this never was her story. And while she can be a great writer, we see she is never able to come up with her own ideas and the ones she have is derivative of other stories. It is a subtle and clever nod to a gap between being a good writer and being a good author or creator (an offer to write for existing IP disgusts her, perhaps because she is confronted by what she doesn\u2019t want to admit is her strength). \u2018It all boils down to self-interest\u2026If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it's rigged in your favor.\u2019While the marketing grab here is definitely the idea of colonizing another\u2019s work and culture and passing it off as your own (there are many moments for readers to fist bump the novel and say \u201cHAHA take that shit, \u201cJunie\u201d\u201d) Kuang makes this a symptom of a larger issue. In her acknowledgements, Kuang states that the novel is a \u2018horror story about loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry.\u2019 If your ears perked up at horror story, there are some horror elements late in the novel (though perhaps not enough and it could have been threaded in longer, if I have one complaint it is that the novels episodic feel never quite let individual elements breathe enough and makes the last portion feel a bit like going one step more than needed instead of flowing from the book which would have sidestepped that feeling? Maybe thats just me though). But loneliness does permeate this tale, and we see how authors can feel crushed under the way for-profit publishing makes it a competition who awards winners and losers. One author will get a huge deal and seemingly inexhaustible marketing, while another gets one small print run and no publisher support. Kuang looks at publishing as a rigged enterprise, with a small team of (mostly white) executives deciding what gets sold and more or less deciding what will be a bestseller and informing readers to follow suit. Its not a secret that publishers buy space in chain bookstores or that the Big 5 US publishers are 80% of all publishing revenue. It is a market based on profit, and will be manipulated to ensure profits keep coming.\u2018This industry is built on silencing us, stomping us into the ground, and hurling money at white people to produce racist stereotypes of us.\u2019To June, however, she sees diversity as a problem, thinking she is passed over for authors like Athena because it looks good. Which, if we look at the publishing market, shows that about 75% of published authors in the US are white and a 2020 study showed 95% of all books published were by white authors the previous year.Now everyone probably remembers 2020 was the year many corporations made pledges to be better at diversity, the publishing industry under extra scrutiny as Black authors and anti-racism books were topping the best sellers and showing there was indeed a market for such books, but lets look at the industry itself. Since then, a recent survey shows only a 1% change in the industry, with it being 83% white and that most non-white hires since 2020 are for marketing positions. Which is using \u201cdiversity\u201d as a sales technique again.So what June see\u2019s as a fast-track to success is actually a steep uphill climb. \u2018\"Do you know how much shit Athena got from this industry?\u2019 a character remarks late in the novel, \u2018They marked her as their token, exotic Asian girl. Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected.\u2019 To be a brand is what publishing reduces identity into is the argument seen in the novel. And, if one is reduced to being a brand of themselves, they are now in market competition. I think of author Brandon Taylor saying identity becomes a marketing pitch, and how Real Life was reviewed as about identity when he says it was about lonely that happened to have explorations of identity in the book. I'm reminded of the reasons authors pushed against #OwnVoices labels as Becky Albertalli felt forced to come out to \"justify\" her book and others felt boxed in by it.  \u2018Do you know what it's like to pitch a book and be told they already have an Asian writer? That they can't put out two minority stories in the same season? That Athena Liu already exists, so you're redundant?\u2019Kuang examines how the idea of being a brand exists in the outskirts of publishing as well. We have the twitter fights where people exist as a self-brand of being antagonists, we have goodreads reviewers where their brand is taking down popular authors (some lines that may sting are remarks from other authors to not read goodreads and harsh takes are more about feeding ego than worthwhile criticism), and journalists who make a brand at hot takes. However, we have to remember that June is directing us to look at how everyone else is the problem instead of her. So while through her telling many of the critiques are cast as villains, the fictional journalist Adele Sparks-Sato (a nod to Andrea Long Chu as Vartika pointed out) is not wrong when writing that June\u2019s version of Athena\u2019s novel \u2018joins novels like The Help and The Good Earth in a long line of what I dub historical exploitation novels: inauthentic stories that use troubled pasts as an entertaining set piece for white entertainment.\u2019\u2018The appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes.\u2019-Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism There is a good deal of nuance in this book about how the commodification of art is an issue, but also a reminder that we can\u2019t scapegoat our own actions on that entirely. There are some great little jabs in this\u2014Junie Song ordering a Miss Saigon drink only to find it \u201ctoo sweet\u201d for her tastes\u2014and it does emphasize the problems of representing a different culture from a western lens. As Edward Said wrote \u2018the power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging is very important to culture and imperialism,\u2019 and argued that literature can be a form of colonialism by establishing a perception of a different culture or geography, and in the editing process of The Last Front we watch June make concessions on the text in order to appeal more to a white reader as requested by her publisher. Yes, she did actually do a great deal of research, and her opinion is the criticisms of cultural issues in the book are \u2018exclusive cultural snobbishness and authenticity testing\u2019 that \u2018are only a form of gatekeeping,\u2019 though later criticisms of her book are that her misunderstanding of how names or families work, or how her positions on certain issues imply a stance on current Chinese politics that are so beyond her understanding can be harmful. Some readers find it to read as a white-savioir narrative, something we know was manufactured by changing certain characters to be white characters to better fit the market needs. Which also returns us to the idea that art under capitalism will always be in service to profits. Yellowface by R.F. Kuang is a delightful novel with the fierceness of an unfolding scandal that makes us confront many key issues hotly debated in the literary world right now. I enjoyed the nuance here in how it exposes problems from many angles, but does not allow that to be an excuse for bad behavior. Understanding is not the same as condoning here, and it is a page-turning trip watching June dip and dodge as her usurped empire continuously threatens to crash down around her. Kuang writes with confidence and precision and Yellowface makes for an excellent look at the literary world and the commodification of art.4.5/5\u2018Isn\u2019t that what ghosts do? Howl, moan, make themselves into spectacles? That\u2019s the whole point of a ghost, is it not? Anything to remind you that they\u2019re still there. Anything to keep you from forgetting.\u2019Update: I got to hear R.F. Kuang speak about the book yesterday! She was DELIGHTFUL, discussed why she dislikes how publishing turns identity into marketing metrics, the books Beautiful World, Where Are You, Ferrante's Neapolitan novels and told everyone to read Murderbot. So well spoken, intelligent, and a real wonderful author.",

      "review_text": "lmao.the frustration, as always, is that rf kuang is an intelligent and steady-handed writer. she is ahead of many of her peers in craft as much as sales: she writes a page-turner, she crafts a strong perspective, she is horror-writer good at making the reader feel gut-churning revulsion (whether or not she earns the strong emotion she likes to pull out is another question), and in this book she's capable of being funny. like here's a perfect paragraph, in which our pernicious white heroine works with her editor to chop and change the manuscript she stole:The hardest part is keeping track of all the characters. We change almost a dozen names to reduce confusion. Two different characters have the last name Zhang, and four have the last name Li. Athena differentiates them by giving them different first names, which she only occasionally uses, and other names that I assume are nicknames (A Geng, A Zhu; unless A is a last name and I\u2019m missing something), or Da Liu and Xiao Liu, which throws me for a loop because I thought Liu was a last name, so what are Da and Xiao doing there? Why are so many of the female characters named Xiao as well? And if they\u2019re family names, does that mean everyone is related? Is this a novel about incest? But the easy fix is to give them all distinct monikers, and I spend hours scrolling through pages on Chinese history and baby name sites to find names that will be culturally appropriate.like it's absolutely executing all of its tricks as it should: the blinkers of a close first person perspective, the legible different reality underneath. it's not subtle but when done in satire it's not AS hamhanded as kuang's dramatic instincts, per other books. readers who know chinese will scream, readers who don't will still feel their brain itch. the authorial hand is capable.the author is capable... of more than she writes. the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope. in previous books that meant that the sense of history was strong and the rest of the work of writing fiction\u2014character work, plot, tone, anything reliant on the imagination\u2014was comparatively weak. here there's no research to hold it up, just kuang's own posting habits and career success. the step down from jstor to twitter is a violent stumble.kuang is an accomplished academic but a deeply incurious writer. that is on sharp display here, in a book that is meant to depict success and failure in the literary-commercial circuit\u2014something that kuang knows little about. kuang is a genre writer who achieved crossover commercial success after blowing up on tiktok. her debut was promising and lauded but not uniquely vaunted; she received genre award noms (not wins) but her books blew up on tiktok after the fact and she launched an incredibly successful book this year in the genre space, off the back of her tiktok fame. everything she knows about succeeding she knows about inside her particular bubble, and also, because she has been succeeding since she was an undergrad baby, has been told\u2014and genuinely believes\u2014that she has hit the summit of success. this leaves her totally inequipped to write about what literary success looks like when engineered by the house. r.f. kuang has no belief that there is a form of publishing greatness beyond that which has been bestowed upon r.f. kuang, and a wilful desire not to google further.the 'publishing details' on display are... well, they all exist IN publishing, curate a FORM of commercial success, and are familiar to kuang, but they don't match the book as described here (a lit-commercial wwii doorstopper, written by a chinese-american author and butchered into commercial sentimentality by a white author and editor, think the bulletproof success of american dirt even in the thick of its cancellation). mainstream literary successes don't come up through pitchwars. mainstream commercial novels don't come up in most book box deals because there is a form of literary success that is not reliant on superfans buying multiple copies apiece. there's a part where our heroine lists the major american literary awards her major literary-commercial war novel is up for and starts with: the goodreads choice awards. posting FROM this bad website: please be serious. it's fitting that the cover looks more like a designed arc than like a book.there's a note in the babel prologue that i think about all the time with kuang's work, where she says that she was so dazzled by the sight of an oyster tower at a particular oxford party that she put it in the book even though oysters in victorian england were trash food for peasants\u2014she didn't want to capture the dazzle or the waste so much as she wanted to write down her experience beat for beat, and could not conceive of an emotional reality that she did not personally live. this is an oyster tower book. this is embarrassing and technically inaccurate mimesis all the way down, solely interested in kuang's own interests. wow your heroines live in dc? and you lived in dc? they met at yale? you go to yale? omigod rebecca that's so crazy. there was a shorthand term back in the sporking days (i know, i hate my withered hag fingers for typing this too) on LIVEJOURNAL (HAG FINGERS) called 'pepper jack cheese' that was like \"hermione ate a sandwich with pepper jack cheese (a/n: that's my favorite cheese!)\", the phenomenon where the author would gigglingly and obviously insert a few of their real-life favorite things into the story. kuang's pepper jack cheese is whistlepig whiskey, name-dropped bafflingly twice as a signifier for the nicest possible whiskey, and also every single detail.it is like. skin-crawlingly secondhand embarrassing to watch an author write their own life beat for beat and also be like 'everyone hated her because she was TOO pretty and TOO smart'. every critique that has ever been leveled against kuang goes into the mouth of her proxy's haters, including the pernicious and grasping white heroine. the belief that her haters are racist comes in a distant second to the belief that her haters are jealous\u2014of her success, of her telegenic prettiness, of her comfortable life. maybe baby but look at the material: there's room for improvement. it is disappointing to watch someone technically skilled grind their intellectual curiosity down to a nub via posting and self-obsession, and it's humiliating to watch an oxbridge-ivy phd student say 'talk to the hand! and DON'T tell me to log off' for three hundo pages. is this the best she can do? does SHE think this is the best she can do? i'm worried that she does.",

      "review_text": "Whew child. Some of these reviews are doing exactly what Kuang was pointing out through Yellowface. It\u2019s interesting to watch it happen in real time. While I don\u2019t have extensive knowledge of her work, I think what Kuang is doing in this book is actually quite brilliant.At the most basic of levels, Yellowface is a mash of various genres that follows the passive aggressive \u201cfriendship\u201d of Athena and June, two authors in the publishing industry with very different levels of success. Athena has received her big break while June has remained a struggling author. In an absurd (truly absurd if I\u2019m being quite honest haha) turn of events, Athena chokes while engaging in a pancake eating contest with June. After her death, June makes the decision to steal one of her manuscripts and pass it off as her own. What follows next is chaotic descent into the world of publishing and the book community. What Worked: SO MUCH OF THIS BOOOK WORKED! I\u2019ve seen the countless criticisms of Kuang inserting herself too much into this book as well as the criticisms that indicate that there isn\u2019t much to be gained from reading this book. I wholeheartedly disagree. Oh, my friends, there is much to be gained. Neither of the characters is likeable and that is INTENTIONAL. This isn\u2019t a way to illustrate that everyone in publishing is selfish, but a means to question how much the reader falls into the trap of engaging with the model minority myth. The expectation that Athena is supposed to be likeable is deeply woven in the sociological phenomena that stereotypes many Asian communities as successful, smart, likeable, diligent, docile, etc and the idea that Athena doesn\u2019t fit into that role has made some readers feel uncomfortable whether it is consciously or subconsciously.Kuang\u2019s evaluation of the publishing industry is layered and forces both publishing and the bookish community to do some reevaluation. What she singlehandedly captures in this book has been the biggest criticism that many of us have been vocal about since 2020. Publishing used the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement to claim to want more diversity and has in some ways published more diverse books; however, have we really paid attention to what those stories have centered? Trauma versus joy. So many of these stories have been centered on generational trauma, books that are used to educate and make the White masses feel better about not knowing much about diverse experiences prior to 2020. Marginalized voices in publishing are \u201cpermitted\u201d to be a part of the community as long we play the roles that we are supposed to play. Once we begin to infiltrate the industry too much, those same people with \u201cBLM\u201d in their twitter bios, the same people who claim to be liberal do the same damn mental gymnastics June did to excuse her behavior. The system was designed for June to do what she did and the moment that marginalized communities \u201csteal\u201d the shine, it\u2019s okay to push back because as June believes she\u2019s the true minority and oppressed person in all of this. Don\u2019t believe me, you should check out the TikTok made by an author who claims that white writers now get turned down because all agents want are BIPOC writers. Or better yet, just listen to foolishness that was uttered from James Patterson who had the audacity to state the White men are the truly oppressed writers in the industry. And let\u2019s take this a step further and look at how Kuang illustrated the danger that publishing has ultimately created with it\u2019s use of terms like #ownvoices. Athena wasn\u2019t ever allowed to write outside of trauma. She\u2019s pigeonholed into only writing one thing. And honestly, I\u2019m sure that happens more than we would like to believe. Authors who want to explore something outside of their \u201cassigned\u201d roles either get turned down or the marketing is trash. It delves deeper into the question of who is allowed to tell what story? Was Athena any better of a fit to tell the story of Chinese laborers of WWI than June? Is research enough to tell something outside of one\u2019s lived experience? These are things to think about and something that we are confronted with every day in this community. Think about books like American Dirt and Memoirs of a Geisha. This book is both absurd and unhinged because so is publishing and the book community. And I\u2019ve been involved in all of it for so many years. Kuang told ya\u2019ll to kiss her ass with this book. She is behaving in the complete opposite manner that is \u201cexpected\u201d of her as young, thin, conventionally beautiful Asian woman. And the fact that she owns that shit makes so many people feel uncomfortable. And quite frankly I applaud her for that. BIPOC writers and creators are tired of the expectation that we are supposed to behave, create, write, and provide educational pieces in way that makes others feel comfortable. We\u2019re supposed to applaud White people for the amazing work they\u2019ve done in \u201callowing\u201d us to enter the spaces and \u201cgive\u201d us the opportunity to tell \u201cour stories.\u201d It\u2019s laughable at this point and while ya\u2019ll give Kuang these 1 and 2 star reviews, she\u2019s going to be laughing her pretty, thin, and educated ass all the way to the damn bank.",

      "review_text": "If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it\u2019s rigged in your favor.\n4.5 stars. Holy shit, I had an absolute blast reading this! I inhaled it in a day. Forgive me if I make no sense because I stayed up late to finish it!To be honest, I wasn't going to read Yellowface. I found Kuang's Babel to be so painfully boring and didactic, like reading a textbook, that I thought we were parting ways for good. But then it seemed like everyone I know read this and liked it, so curiosity got the better of me. And, wow, is this really the same author? What a ride. The suspense! The vitriol! The fucking audacity!I want to take a moment to acknowledge something I found quite ironic-- Kuang's other books are fantasy books about magic and colonialism and boarding schools while this one has the very lukewarm premise of being about authors and the publishing process... but, my god, when it comes to pageturners even The Poppy War had nothing on this.A satire, is it? Well, maybe, but I've never read such a gripping and suspenseful satire. Kuang rips the publishing industry to shreds with this book, and she does it from the perspective of a white author who steals the first draft manuscript of a dead Chinese author. I sat open-mouthed pretty much the entire time wondering if she was going to get away with it or get caught. Kuang uses a lot of social media to tell this story and it is highly effective at keeping the pacing up. We all know social media is a shitstorm of people vying for attention, performing for validation and, occasionally, making genuinely important points, and we see it all play out here to the extreme.I thought Babel lacked nuance, but Yellowface is the complete opposite. Both June and Athena are complex characters. Athena is not allowed to simply be the perfect victim and, in fact, what emerges over the course of the novel is someone who is quite unlikable herself. June has done something objectively bad, but the author resists the temptation to paint her as one-dimensional. Her desperation and self-delusion, her anxiety and her jealousy, feel real.At first glance, June appears to be the villain, but I think it becomes clear as the story progresses that this is much bigger than June. Kuang calls out the publishing industry and the messed up way books are primarily marketed through a social media performance. The young authors choking on their jealousy as they are pitted against one another. The agents and editors urging authors to publish \u201canything\u201d while they have \u201csocial capital\u201d regardless of whether it\u2019s good or not. And, of course, the way many in the publishing industry view \"diversity\" as a marketing buzzword to sell more books, rather than having the genuinely noble goal of diversifying literature. As Brett, June's agent, admits at one point: \"But at the end of the day all that really matters is cash flow.\"This is a chaotic, highly-frustrating, impossible-to-put-down book. I rollercoasted from emotion to emotion reading it and I'm sure I will still be talking about it long after I'm done writing this review.",

      "review_text": "This is a compelling, cynical, and thought-provoking satire that delves into themes of plagiarism, racism, and internet trolling. It offers a realistic portrayal of the publishing industry within the framework of a heart-pounding thriller. The story revolves around an anti-heroine driven by power and insecurity, who assumes the identity of her deceased friend to publish a masterpiece. Loneliness and the desperate desire for recognition serve as driving forces, pushing the protagonist to extreme measures.Remarkably, I found myself attached to a book despite disliking the main character. At times, I wished I could physically enter the story and confront June Hayward/ Juniper Song, who committed the ultimate crime: stealing her late friend Athena Liu's unpublished book. The reasons behind this act of creative theft are complex and include jealousy, thirst for power, honoring her friend's work in the best way possible, and seeking personal gain. It is a tale that explores unfairness, harbored resentment, and a thirst for karmic justice.One of the standout aspects of the book is the author's astute commentary on the perils faced by writers, such as internet trolls who use their freedom of speech rights to berate and belittle their creations. The story skillfully examines the commodification of writers, where their looks, personality, color of their skin and online presence become as important as their writing itself.This book truly blew my mind. I was unable to put it down, yet also needed to take breaks due to the chaotic and anxiety-inducing experience of living within Juniper's mind. The character evokes strong emotions, including frustration towards her misogyny, blind ambition, and obnoxious justifications for her actions.It is worth noting that Juniper is not the sole antagonist in the narrative. The judgmental and self-righteous individuals surrounding her also exhibit misogynistic tendencies and relish in criticizing and witnessing the downfall of others, all while raising their champagne glasses in celebration. Even Athena, portrayed as socially awkward and naive, adds depth to the story as a potential soul-sucking character for a gripping plotline.In this book, nobody is a saint, as being good-hearted does not guarantee financial security, career success, fame, or power. The author skillfully portrays flawed and complex characters who challenge the reader's perceptions.Overall, this realistic and thrilling read left me feeling anxious and evoked a multitude of emotions including fear, hate, and sadness. It successfully accomplished its mission of shaking the reader to their core and provoking deep thoughts that linger for days. The essence of a masterpiece lies in its ability to challenge readers and evoke a range of feelings, and this book achieves just that.I wholeheartedly consider this one of the best books of the year, and I urge you not to overlook it or let it languish in your \"to be read\" list. Grab a copy and immerse yourself in its urgent and captivating narrative.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter",

      "review_text": "i'm being generous already when i say that it is OK, because i personally do not like these kinds of books. while i appreciate the social commentary and the look inside the publishing industry, i found the tone and execution quite heavy-handed. it's certainly well-written, but personally i didn't like the writing style or the narrative voice. i know rfk intended the characters to be unlikeable, but i did not root for them at any point of the book. i was irritated most of the time, so i can't really say that i enjoyed reading this. i've read my fair share of books peopled with unlikeable characters, but this one here is just unbearable and repetitive. it got so boring the last third of the book that i had to take a nap before continuing.i think my main problem is that the author's personal voice bleeds through the text and does not give the reader much room to think. rfk frames the story in a way that clearly shows the readers what she thinks and, in a way, she's telling us what to think. in tpw i excused it as a debut author's mistake, while in babel i found her passion about the themes charming\u2014 but here in yellowface i realize that rfk is unfortunately incapable of separating her own voice from the text, which is very grating to my brain. i won't get into the specifics, but it's just SO irritating to read. it's satirical and supposed to be \"darkly funny\" but i guess i just did not understand the jokes (wherever they may be). i also think that i would have appreciated the book more had it cut back on the pop culture references (which i do not think will age well btw). i would have liked this more had it been written with more finesse and subtlety. anyway, i don't think rfk is cut out to write in this genre.

Every chapter was like watching a trainwreck. I knew it would just get worse but I could not for the life of me look away. June was unhinged. The kind of unhinged that believes her own lies and thinks she is morally in the right. Girl took delulu to another level.What astounded me most was how legitimately real her voice was. Hats off to Rebecca Kuang. She killed this.Honestly i had fun reading this book. It incited so many feelings in me (mainly rage and distress). There were parts where i was in utter disbelief of June, i had to take a step back from the book. I do wonder though, what with all the niche references to the recurring bookish online drama and controversy that gets dragged up month in and month out, how a casual book reader would experience this book \ud83e\udd14.",

      "review_text": "July 2023 \u2b50\ufe0f4.5\nI reread this for my book club and am so glad we did a buddy read and live show. This is a book worthy of discussion. It has both blatant and nuanced themes of racism and xenophobia that might go over some reader's heads or might seem too in-your-face for others. A group discussion can help reader's recognize the realism of R.F. Kuang's literary approach and see that even if you don't relate to the content, you still have to understand that it's other people's reality.Will you enjoy a single character? Categorically NO. But you will walk away with a greater understanding of the many failings of the publishing industry and how you might be unconsciously taking part in some of those failings.It's eye opening. It's ballsy. It's crass. It's wild and brilliant.I will say that the half star reduction is solely because of Candice. While her insistence upon sensitivity reader's was a good call in my opinion, her manner of calling things out and getting things done were over-dramatized to the nth degree. While I think R.F. Kuang is brilliant for having the opposing side of June also be contrarian, Candice didn't fill the spot I wanted her to in opposition to June. I know it wasn't a character to necessarily root for instead of June. But I saw June's motives and her horrible mental manipulation that she attempted to gaslight ourselves into believing were just. But Candice just felt cartoonishly villainous. Maybe that's just my view of her. Other's could read it differently. But, overall, this is absolutely worth your time. Please read this. It is a shining gem in the 2023 literary world. \nMarch 2023 \u2b50\ufe0f4.5\nRF Kuang DID THAT. This woman fears nothing and no one. What a hero.She said \"Talk about the publishing industry? How about the racism, misogyny, xenophobia, plagiarism, pretty-privilege and everything else revolting that comes along with it? You don't want to acknowledge that? Welp, too bad. Cause I'm gonna write it so well, you'll be begging to publish it.\"I thought that RF Kuang was going to write about her experience with publishing through the eyes of the main character. But that's the direct opposite approach she takes. Her self-insert is actually with Athena, the main character's college friend turned renowned author. The main character is a depiction of mild mannered racist individuals who shroud themselves in acceptance as long as it doesn't affect them and balk at the idea of racism until directly faced with equality and the loss of superiority it gives them.This is an excellent look at how real and deep rooted racism is. It's everywhere and in everyone. It just isn't always shouting it's ideals. It's sitting still while someone else does something harmful. It's deluding yourself when you get the job over someone of color when you know you're under qualified. It's in so many small and micro ways. And it's absolutely vile to watch/read. But very eye opening in a way that I think is necessary for the publishing industry as it stands.I so appreciate RF Kuang for writing this and continuing to be an absolute genius. Like, how does a human being's brain contain this much complexity and eloquence? I'm baffled.",

RFK is a fantastic writer and skillfully navigates the loneliness and pressure authors feel, making the drastic decisions juniper makes feel somewhat morally grey rather than outright wrong (as we know plagiarism is). and even though its done in a satirical way (which isnt my favourite), i enjoyed the exploration of topics like authors in reader spaces, own voices stories, and the different standards and treatment of white vs minority authors.the only reason this isnt getting 5 stars is because of a personal problem. i have a really weird pet peeve of real world things mentioned in fiction. i like realistic/contemporary stories, but pop culture references bug the crap out of me. so all of the talk of US politics and presidents, very real famous authors, even the commentary about goodreads and tiktok, took me out of the story.so, a little too \u201creal world\u201d for my personal reading preferences, but there is no doubt this is a provocative novel that sheds light on various aspects of the book world. \u21a0 4 stars",

      "review_text": "HOLY SHIT.I bet any other author could have tried with a premise like this and would have inevitably failed. No one writes morally grey like R.F. Kuang and I'm saying this because my anxiety skyrocketed the more I read + I'm still haunted by these characters days later. It basically was like a trainwreck from beginning to end, where you know things are only getting worse but you're still so weirdly fascinated with it you can't stop looking.I'm positive I've never read something so meta in my entire life. This one is for the publishing industry nerds, and honestly I foresee this being very difficult to market outside of such a niche community. It was so in-depth into the industry it made my heart sing and despare at the same time (as a publishing post-graduate first and then as a compulsive reader part of the online community). It managed to highlight a slew of things that make publishing not such a great place to be at in very few pages and I'm amazed. To me this book kind of felt like a very long article but with twists and turns. Now I know why they released arcs so early (looking at you, HarperCollins \ud83d\udc40). Book twitter will have a field day with this one...What a choice to have the main narrative voice be the plagiarizer (and in first person at that). Both Athena and June are awful people, and I love that neither of them is a saint, but reading the entire thing from June's pov? Insane. She's a frustrating character, not gonna lie, but she's also deliciously realistic as a two-faced, self-absorbed and dishonest manipulator that always has an excuse ready. She goes out of her way to say to the reader that she wants to do something for poc every chance she gets, but the reality is that she's a bitch trying to profit from it all in an industry that lets her do it. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not too difficult to miss her slipping into a plain wrong mentality and lol, basic whiteness. You think you're safe as the external reader? Not a chance. I'm not proud to say I fell straight into R.F. Kuang's trap, because was I seriously rooting for such a cheater the entire time? This book brainwashed me into supporting someone who stole a whole manuscript immediately after witnessing the author's death and reaching stardom by publishing it as her own. I got to the point where I was scared she was going to get caught and hoped she would get out of it unscathed. My brain ignored all the red flags and procedeed to scam me until the very end. I mean, of course I ended up wishing she would kill someone to shut them up. Of course I got second-hand anxiety from her messing up with her publishing team and at her events. Of course I cared about her mental health. Am I okay or what? Is it time for me to get theraphy too?On the other hand, Athena is harder to grasp. You really need to have the whole picture with her, which you only get by reading the book till the end. I loved the way RFK slowly built her character. You only read about her from June's perpective when she's already dead and still she comes through as the main character, not less because June is literally obsessed with her. Well-written toxic friendships are my bread and butter and the one in here was one of my favorites. The way it was dealt with: nothing less of spectacular. I found June's morality to be the most interesting aspect of this book, but the relationship between her and Athena comes in second for sure.Much care went into the secondary characters too. Even when they only fully appeared once or twice, they always had a well-rounded story behind them. I can apply that specifically to the publishing team and Geoff. From that last one it's again apparent and so on-the-nose how me and RFK's morally grey characters just work together. What can I say? I'm fascinated with them. Geoff reminded me of so many white male authors on twitter but he just had a pull. I loved that he was so pathetic, that I never knew what he was going to do and then, when I least expected it and as naturally as possible, he showed a completely different side to himself.There are a couple of things I didn't completely enjoy, mainly the pop culture references (way too many, half of them were necessary, the others not so much), and the ending. Overall the ending itself wasn't bad, I loved how it wrapped up, but that final showdown bordered on cartoonish and because of that it was hard to take it seriously. I also feel like the final chapter is missing, although I understand what this novel is actually supposed to be (have I said meta already?).In conclusion, an amazing foray into general fiction by R.F. Kuang. I swear this woman can do no wrong. Give her whatever topic to write about and I bet she can create something incredible out of the most boring premise. I think it's impressive how she took these modern controversies and wrote them into a twisty unputdownable story. It seems to me like it's a new experiment from her but at the same time a really smart jab at publishing too. I wouldn't say it's a perfect book and I'm unsure if I would reread it like The Poppy War trilogy; however I can't exclude it won't live in my mind rent free as I still catch myself heavily thinking about it.",

      "review_text": "Oh, Booktwitter, Bookstagram! You lied.This wasn't v. good.Yellowface is about June Heyward who steals a manuscript from her best-selling author frenemy. After her friend dies in a bizarre accident, June polishes up the prose and sells the book as her own without crediting her friend.Most of the book is just internal angst about Twitter.Maybe I am not the key demographic for this book (I'm in the over 35 crowd), but how I approach social media is like Marie Kondo - if it doesn't spark joy, I get rid of it. If people spew hate, I just block them.So I don't really feel like we were making progress in this novel because I would not have given any credence to these naysayers.There is some commentary on the book community. Some of it was interesting.I will clarify a few things.If you write a negative review, you are not supposed to tag the author.While the internet may seem like The Wild West, GoodReads does have Community Guidelines. They state, \"Criticizing the opinions of others is permitted, but attacking individuals for their opinions is not.\"Personally, I have never had a problem with an author, publisher, or GoodReads so you can write negative reviews (just make sure not to violate the Community Guidelines).This book does bring up some interesting points around who gets to tell certain stories and plagiarism.I found this issue of plagiarism particularly ironic because Yellowface didn't strike me as very original, essentially a mashup of The Plot by Jean Hanoff Korelitz and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum. Furthermore, RF Kuang had a scene in The Poppy War (published 2018) where the main character was training by carrying a pig up a mountain.Well, there is a story in Holes (published 1998) by Louis Sachar where someone carries a pig up a mountain.However, people create retellings all the time. There are lots of familiar and time-tested tropes and plots. At what point is it plagiarism? This would have been a great book for a book club.Overall, this was an average book, definitely not the riveting book, have to read in one sitting book that the world has lost its mind over.Connect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta",

      "review_text": "EDIT: This video sums up my thoughts. I thought it was very inappropriate how the author used an objectively bitchy and untrustworthy narrator as a mouthpiece for all of the REAL LIFE criticisms that the actual author has received in real life. By doing this, all of the critiques seem like they come from people who are just jealous and have no valid arguments against her self-insert martyr author character Athena (who mirrors the real life author in many, MANY ways). I read this book one year before it was actually published, so there might have been changes, but from this video and other reviews I've seen, not much is different from when I first read it.I will be honest up front: this review is entirely plagiarized. Was I not meant to admit that? Should I have, instead, gone on long, rambling, and yet tersely flat paragraphs about how ironic it is that I am negatively critiquing a book about plagiarism by using the same points as everyone else? Should I call this satire\u2014granted that there is nothing humorous and that I am not particularly strongly exaggerating anything\u2014as I amateurly write prose so unabashedly written in my own voice that it would be impossible to separate any idea from my own? Because that appears to be the direction this book has gone in.I am not the first to say that this reads like RFK's notes app consciousness, nor will I be the last. While I will not get into specifics, as this is an incredibly early copy of the book, I will say that anyone who even remotely knows anything about the author will see the similarities between them and...certain things. Now, I have no issue with an author writing from experience. 'Write what you know' is both an incredibly popular and successful piece of advice given to wannabee-writers. But fuck, at some point one has to wonder about the motivation behind it. Simply put, because there is no other way to put it, this book felt like a circle-jerk. I should have expected such a thing from a satire on the publishing industry written by a prominent figure within it. It is typical\u2014of course they will ridicule things like social media and how the masses view them. Of course they will glower at criticisms and mock fellow authors. Is that not the purpose of satire? But this feels like so much more than that. Instead, I feel as if RFK is speaking to me in a jest. Like she is pointing toward the book community, head cocked to the side, cheekily winking in our shared knowledge of their ridiculousness. Her eyes say, look at them\u2014look at their silliness and their worries and their jealousy. See how they behave like animals, that group of people outside of our circle. Like she'll laugh right after, content in her knowledge that she lives in an absurd space, and that only we understand its absurdity. My first tip-off\u2014no, not my first, though perhaps the most obscene\u2014is how she uses our untrustworthy protagonist. RFK is, without a doubt, excellent at writing bad people. I have never argued against this, and I rather think I never will. But in this way, I feel almost uncomfortable when her unlikable characters serve the role of real people. She mocks criticism she has received in the past for her very real, non-fictitious books, through these characters. It feels, once again, like a terrible inside joke I have been privy to. As if the reader is meant to read these and think, these ridiculous characters! To say such things as this! And yet when one is aware of the author's actual past, it becomes...awkward. That is, she is not an author of subtlety. The satire could not work because it was not sufficiently...anything! I did not find it funny, nor was it so exaggerated as to be comical. The writing in general did not work for me. Babel, for all of its long-winded sentences and unending paragraphs of description, felt like a declaration of loyalty to words. This book, instead, felt like it was made by someone who could not care less for such things. This is, I understand, literary fiction. RFK has gone out of her normal bubble of fantasy to try something new, and I truly commend her for it. But I must question if this is the right genre for her. She is blunt and uncouth, neither of which are particularly bad\u2014nor do I even dislike it\u2014but which are painfully obvious throughout this. I felt like I was reading one of those High School creative writing class exercises (something which I actually do on a daily basis) where the young, inexperienced creator feels the need to say things like \"but you'll never guess what happens next\" and \"this is something that'll come up later\" in their first point of view narrative as if the reader is not skillful enough to gradually realize such things later on. Its modernist setting equally paid a part in this. There are only so many times you can name-drop an author or celebrity or, God-be-damned, fucking Harry Potter before realizing you have written something that reads like a Buzzfeed quiz. No, the narration did not work for me, nor did I think that any of it ultimately paid off in its strange and wholly random ending I can only describe as, \"really?\"I struggle to find the words to end this. I'm afraid I have run out of other people's thoughts to steal as I reword them into my own. I want to clarify that I do like the author's other works. Out of the five books of hers I've read (all of her works except for that one anthology she worked on), I've really liked and sometimes loved three of them. But that doesn't mean I'm not capable of thinking that this was not her best genre, nor her best work by any means. This book felt like the worst possible self-awareness. The type shared over grins and knowing smiles, wherein both parties are partaking in the mockery of a group of people they think themselves entirely separated from. This is a book that both ridicules authors while falling to its knees, proclaiming its undying devotion to them. Funny enough, I praised Babel for a much similar sentiment. But where in that book I enjoyed the constant switch between criticizing the power and history of words to being mesmerized over them, Yellowface felt more like a sledgehammer. Love me, it says like I love you\u2014all of us\u2014the sophisticated and knowledgeable professionals. Those of us who do not care for the social media mob, for we are above it. Those of us willfully scornful of such things, for if we pretend to each other long enough that we are all on the same page against the absurdist, laughable masses, we might start to believe it. arc received for an honest review",

      "review_text": "Madelein L'Engle said, \"You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children.\" If Rebbeca Kuang saw this quote, she must have mixed it up because she wrote this book as though it's meant for children who want to graduate to adult fiction. Yellowface is an unsubtle, hammer-to-the-forehead quasi-treatise about the dangers of White Women. Those villainised hacks who never see how what they're doing is wrong. They're Karens, but they voted for Biden. No really, June Hayward says she is a Democrat, and liberal, and voted for Biden multiple times within the book. Hayward a mediocre author who is friends (and we're not really convinced why) with a Chinese American literary star Athena Liu who dies suddenly after a pancake goes down the wrong hole, and Hayward is too inept to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre. After this, Hayward steals Liu's manuscript about Chinese laborers forcefully conscripted by the French during World War 1. The caucasity is unsurprising, trite, and racist covering all the beats we experienced every time we covered Discourse about films like The Blindside, Hidden Figures Greenbook, and books like The Help, or American Dirt.This book is not funny, it's not particularly well-written, with a literal typo in the first few pages The editor who did got fired,. The narrative is repetitive and disjointed, like puzzle pieces forced together from different boxes. There were scenes where June's narration is simply exhausting. I have to remind Athena this every single time. She has a goldfish\u2019s memory when it comes to my problems\u2014it takes two or three repetitions for anything to stick. First of all, Rebecca, goldfish don't have short memories. Some can keep them for years. Secondly, you already said this multiple times. We aren't \"goldfish\", we aren't sieves. We don't need incessant spoonfeeding about something you already said. In the opening stints, June mentions how her debut was left to languish by her editor at the pathetic imprint that was the only one that gave her a chance. It didn't need to be repeated. It also speaks to a certain lack of, perhaps, awareness by Rebecca about how publishing classifies books. When they acquire a manuscript, the books are then delineated, and different budgets are assigned to the books based on what they think will be most profitable. In the current environment, poorly written horny romantasy, AI and climate change scare stories, American POC history and struggle porn, badly written romance, and whatever book Booktok bestows its benevolent virality are the ones most likely to get publishing buzz. Majority of the authors are very white, very North American, or very British. June's lack of awareness of how publishing works spoke more to Rebecca's ignorance or laziness. And ultimately, her scapegoating of publishing \"wanting diverse stories\" rings hollow. Maybe this story would have been better if June had whitewashed a literary navel-gazing story about vulnerability and identity. Beyond the amateurish prose that suffered from sudden bursts of Thesaurus-itis, for example, on Pg. 6 Rebecca writes, It\u2019s so fucking arbitrary. Or perhaps not arbitrary, but it hinges on factors that have nothing to do with the strength of one\u2019s prose. then on Pg. 102 Can't we all get behind decrying antimiscegenation? June also says Athena's prose is repetitive while her monologues feel like a scratched CD. One could argue that Rebecca is trying to show how June is unaware of her lack of talent but you can't help but wonder if she is just a serviceable writer. The book takes pains to be accessible for mass audiences. Rebecca also wants to explain every little detail such as ARCs and sensitivity readers-jargon everyone who is involved in The Community would know. June even goes on a diatribe when discussing a potential movie deal and says, Accessibility matters. and when undressing the stolen manuscript that's \"difficult\" to read, she says, It\u2019s distracting from the central narrative. Reading should be an enjoyable experience, not a chore. Is this satire or Rebecca explaining why the prose is so bland and repetitive. My suspension of disbelief was unwilling and abused by how ridiculous some of the events in publishing happen. When June mentions the Goodreads Choice Awards more times than more prestigious ones, I couldn't help but wonder if Rebecca doesn't understand literary Oscars season or if she was trying to pander to Goodreads Choice Awards voters (this book will definitely be listed under Best Fiction). The GCAs are a popularity contest. Rarely do people read all the books listed, they only vote for what they loved. Additionally, no discerning reader who wants a book about Chinese labourers in WW1 would give a fuck about GCAs. Or is this a 4D chess Trojan horse where readers are actually being unwittingly tested as a focus group? Some people will prefer a female friendship story where race dynamics are explored (The Hate U Give), or perhaps they will want a thriller involving authors and books (Too Close To Home by Linwood Barclay), a meta narrative about who gets to tell a story (Bad Art Friend), a serial plagiariser (look up Jumi Bello), or Asian American nonfiction (Minor Feelings) and Rebecca can pick her next project. Maybe Rebecca is staging herself as the host of the round table to discuss whether authors should interact with reviews. But as we saw with Lauren Hough, the answer is still no. There was also a glaring pattern where June kept pointing out Athena's flaws. How she was once the actual bad art friend, how Twitter Hot Take enthusiasts called her a race traitor. But we never get to delve into that because June believes no one is that deep into Chinese history or politics. Great job, Rebecca. You have shut down your critics for the lack of nuance in Asian history and characters in Babel. Athena is so offensively superficially written that I almost wished we had gotten her point of view, as a villain who wants to step on all faces to the top of the literary throne. The few snippets we get of her prose show she's a much better writer than June and her narration would have been more palatable than June's weapons of mass boredom. There's a certain Discourse we're supposed to have from this book about Bad White Women, and how publishing serves to silence writers of colour. We also have to discuss who gets to tell certain stories. The problem is, we have spoken about this ad nauseum. So who is this book for? Outsiders who would like to know how it works? Adults who wanted a meta vivisection of this insular world but with Dark Themes? Rebecca doesn't know. She says it's a thriller examining the idiosyncracies of publishing. It's not thrilling. And it has a myopic view of how publishing works. About good intentions that went poorly when June always set out to usurp Athena's work from the jump? It's not satire. It's a reverse K\u00fcnstlerroman. Why is it necessary? The book doesn't tell you because it ends like a flaccid plateau. Not only is it boring, but it's just a meme of a clueless White Woman.",

As a non-white person growing up in the States, and disliking it, what made me so interested in the UK as a child? Even now? And even more importantly, as a Vietnamese American, what made me so interested in France? And more so in recent years, China and Japan? It's a hard introspective look, to be sure.This book takes Babel and continues to flip the script. June Hayward, a white American woman struggling to become an author, is frenemies with Athena Liu, publishing darling. June continues to state time and time again that Athena is only famous because she is a minority. How many times have we heard this?June is with Athena when she chokes to death. I implied she maybe had something to do with her death. June is a very unreliable narrator. Do with that what you will. Anyway, Athena has a manuscript that she has begun. June steals, edits, and publishes it. June's new publishers think her name is too white (because she is white), and rebrand her Juniper Song. Ambiguous. As ambiguous as ScarJo's Japaneseness. And Emma Stone's Vietnameseness.June is asked to speak on panels, go to book clubs, and mentor student writers. When the aforementioned people learn she is not Chinese, heads begin to roll. June does not take this in stride. She thinks she is entitled to write Chinese stories, because she \"did research.\" Do we remember the American Dirt debacle? I do. I won't touch that book with a ten foot pole. It's not a matter of who can tell what stories. (Well, it is, but no matter.) It's that a white woman received a seven figure advance telling the trauma stories of a marginalized group that will never see a cent of that. Where are the stories from actual undocumented immigrants? No one in any famous book club will ever read those.",

      "review_text": "\u201dWho has the right to write about suffering?\u201dHave you ever read a book that is so timely and effective in its message that you do not feel the slightest bit qualified to review it? That your thoughts on such a masterpiece are not even worthy of being put to paper, literally or figuratively, because they are trite, vapid, and banal in comparison to the quality of the text being discussed? That\u2019s how I feel trying to put the proverbial pen to paper with my thoughts on Yellowface.Is this book satire? Obviously and not quite so much. What I mean is, it\u2019s clearly satire, but to an extent that these characters are not exact flesh and blood, but the issues discussed in this book are far from farcical. Most reviewers have noticed the central themes in Yellowface rearing their ugly head in the real world, especially in the past few years, so it is refreshing and exhilarating to read a fictional novel encompassing these issues in a way that only R.F. Kuang could create. \u201dGive me your bruises and hurts, she told us, and I will return to you a diamond.\u201dLet\u2019s be clear: June is not a character that you will feel empathy for. She will not be redeemed, rooted for, or endeared by the end; however, watching her downfall is oddly satisfying in a way that I cannot quite explain. The insight into the process of releasing a book with a Big Five publisher is compelling and intriguing, and it\u2019s, sadly, easy to see how something like this story could transpire. The beauty of this tale is no one is safe from criticism; Kuang makes it clear that there are various forms of privilege that transpire across lines of race, class, gender, etc., and every single character really has something to answer for. In one word: Brilliant.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.",

      "review_text": "I'M CRYING, THROWING UP, RIPPING MY HAIR OUT AND THEN CRYING SOME MORE!Rebecca F. Kuang is THE WRITER of our generation. The author, honestly just like with Babel, had me in the palm of her hand from page 1. And my attention lasted until the very last page. I spent every waking hour thinking about this book, while I was reading it and while I was NOT. I cannot possibly imagine something this good can be written, but it turns out it can, I'm witnessing the magic happen, right? I'm not that hard to please when it comes to my reading, and I give five star ratings (fairly) easily. But it doesn't happen every day that I GO MAD loving a book. That fact speaks for itself. R. F. Kuang doesn't speak with or to you when she writes, she HAUNTS you. It takes a genius to achieve that. She explored every possible aspect or every question you might have, every side you could possibly take on this subject, doesn't leave much room for the reviewer, but I'm not complaining (I like my thoughts planted)PLOT The blurb is short and easy to understand, so i don't feel the need to retell it once more (I know I would do a poor job). I saw that most reviews on here surrounded the issues of the publishing industry as the central theme of this book, but I wouldn't agree. Just like with Babel, the racial debate takes the biggest piece of the cake, just dressed in different icing. But again, I'm not complaining. The book community is rarely not problematic, let's be honest, we are witnessing whitewashing and white supremacy on here every day. So, to not be blind and ignorant, we should learn about the topic EVERY DAY. As a white woman, I wasn't offended with any of the thoughts from this book, and I quite frankly think, that hating it (the story it explores) is an act of racism. BABEL Yeah, it's not one of those 'if you like this you'll like that' situations. This book is different in every aspect, if I hadn't known I wouldn't think it was written by the same person. BUT IT'S EQUALLY AS BRILLIANT. Doesn't that really picture the talent and originality of this writer? CHARACTERS I'm quite possibly the biggest fan of morally ambiguous characters. Especially when they're well written, they amaze and intrigue me. Life is far from black and white, right? I feel like the author inserted bits and pieces of herself in each of the characters, I don't feel like she chose just one. Both are writers and artists, both flawed (chronically unoriginal), but both for sure do have redeeming qualities. Sounds a bit fake, but I genuinely think R. F. Kuang was the right person to tell this story. No matter how many times she REINVENTS herself, the story always feels like it was made just and only for her. I can't wait to read the Poppy War trilogy. In the end, the intended question remains: Would it be the same if a white woman wrote this?\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udcd6\ud83d\udc95(What i wrote before reading)This will make me or break me (I'm so serious)",

      "review_text": "I give this book four stars because, one, it\u2019s highly entertaining. For maybe the first fifty pages or so the writing felt a bit dry, though when the plot picks up, I found myself so curious to know: will this white woman who stole an Asian American woman\u2019s work get caught?? Will she confront her own insecurities that led to this? Is Athena actually dead?? R.F. Kuang creates a selfish, self-absorbed main character in June Hayward, with a consistent voice that kept me engaged in Yellowface\u2019s story. I also think this book does open up important conversations. Yes, at times it makes its point bluntly/crudely and in an obvious way, though through this satire Kuang raises deeper questions too, such as whether anyone can remain truly ethical or generous in a brutally capitalist publishing industry. I liked how Kuang didn\u2019t make Athena a perfect character because by doing so, she highlights how people of color can engage in problematic and oppressive practices too.So even though I didn\u2019t agree with all of Kuang\u2019s satirical commentary in Yellowface (e.g., I think Asian Americans should be asked hard, critical questions about glorifying whiteness both in dating partners and in other areas of life), I respect that she seized a popular topic in the publishing industry and made a novel out of it. The exaggerated nature of satire doesn\u2019t always lend itself to a deeper emotional connection with the characters or the story, though I don\u2019t think a deep emotional connection is necessarily the point of this novel. Overall, while I don\u2019t see this novel breaking into my top ten list at the end of this year, I found it an interesting read and one that may be fun to discuss.*also, just to add, this type of thing is still happening all the time, including in other industries. Recently I saw a white woman publish a research paper on Black and Latinx mothers and when I emailed her and asked about her research practices with these communities, she literally just ignored me. And, as I've written about in at least one other review, one time I gently called in a white woman for doing her dissertation on Asian American women (with no Asian American women as coauthors) and she called me aggressive and \"untrusting.\" sigh!",

June's internal monologue was absolutely insane, especially in the first half. I didn't even know how she could dig herself deeper into the hole, but she never failed to dig herself deeper and deeper. I was left with my jaw dropped at the end of multiple chapters. I really enjoyed the insight into the publishing industry that Yellowface gave as well. One of the sentences that struck me the most was \"Bestsellers are chosen. Nothing you do matters\". I assumed this was often the case, however, it opened my eyes to how much ads and promotions for certain books impact the chance of me reading them. Overall I had such a fun time buddy reading Yellowface with Sue! I've heard incredible things about RF Kuang for years, so I am very happy to finally have picked up one of her books. needless to say, I'll be reading her entire backlist!",

      "review_text": "Instagram || Threads || Facebook || Amazon || TikTokUPDATE: after a Shower Thought\u2122, I was inspired to make a video about the symbolism of food in this book and how I interpreted it to be a physical manifestation of the main character's rejection of the culture she was metaphorically trying to devour: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8PN381N/ I'm not the biggest fan of R.F. Kuang's work but I was so drawn into the premise of YELLOWFACE, which asks the question, \"What would happen if a white woman literally stole an Asian woman's work and then published it as her own and sort of got away with it (maybe)?\" It's a daring and troubling question that splits open the way the publishing industry works (and doesn't work), while also showing the desperation and bottomless need for approval that some authors feel while milling away in an industry that moves at a pace far faster than most authors are capable of writing at.June Hayward is an interesting character. She's racist (but doesn't think she is), privileged (again), and incredibly narcissistic, but in her story, she is the tragic heroine fighting against the odds. I think it's always a challenge writing an unlikable character who still feels chillingly human and relatable, and reading YELLOWFACE actually gave me the same high I felt while watching House of Usher. There's something very Faustian and self-damning about June that feels like it could have come right out of a story by Poe.I liked the ending but it wasn't quite the ending I was hoping for. I think it fits, though. And I think the discussions around this novel, because of the subject matter and also because of who wrote it, are interesting. The writing style is so beautiful and it's clear how much Kuang has grown from THE POPPY WAR, which also had a female antiheroine championing An Agenda. Unlike TPW, however, this feels like a very nuanced work.4.5 to 5 stars",

      "review_text": "This heart-wrenching, emotional family saga will shake you to the core. The three-dimensional, layered characterization, and references to Little Women make it easy to connect with each character as they feel like lifelong friends.  The Padavona sisters resemble the March sisters, although they were raised in a Catholic household where their mother taught them to respect saints while their father, Charlie, was an idealistic dreamer who could not provide a financially stable life for his family.Julia and Sylvia carry the attributes of Meg and Jo, respectively. Cecilia is artsy and determined like Amy, and Emeline has a kind heart and selfless behavior, much like Beth.  Julia is a doer, high achiever, and ambitious. She is the second mother of the girls and is closer to the romantic, bookish Sylvie, who is waiting for the man to sweep her off her feet. The twin girls, Cecilia and Emeline, live in their own world, speaking their own language and are each other's best friends. Cecilia is straightforward and stubborn, while Emeline is a nurturer and peacemaker of the family.  William is a lost, introverted guy, raised by his neglectful family who cannot get over the loss of their little daughter and fails to provide the compassion William needs. He is a wallflower until he starts to play basketball with his peers, and his invisibility fades away.When he meets Julia Padavona, she chooses him as her future husband, which means he will marry into the entire Padavona clan. The tight bond between the four sisters affects him a lot, as his own family wants nothing to do with him.  Julia sees William as her next project, creating an ideal husband in her mind, a college professor who is handsomely paid and provides her with a big apartment and kids. She even finds him his first assistant job at college. Julia is the rocket of the family, who likes to control things, but when people make plans, God laughs. An unexpected family scandal and a big tragedy shake the family to its core. A bold decision to choose happiness over misery causes the tight bond between the sisters to break, testing their priorities.  The dark and depressing tone of the book can give you heartache, but the realistic portrayal of the characters helps you connect with them. Each point of view is another creative voice that speaks to your soul. Some of the characters' selfish choices made me angry, and I was frustrated by the stubbornness of others who held themselves back from embracing their own happiness when time was of the essence. However, their behaviors are unfortunately realistic, and we can all find a family member who acts like them.  The ending was extremely emotional, and I cried a lot. I just devoured this book and each character's story slowly. I did not want it to end, and if I had the chance to read about the sisters' granddaughters' stories, I would not say no. Overall, this magnificent book deserves more than five stars. Just read it, read it, and read it.

(pause for raucous laughter.)unfortunately, that's the only thing i found particularly appealing about this whole thing. because it is:1) not literary, but rather the kind of gimmicky and clich\u00e9d writing i expect from books i've never heard of found exclusively at airport bookstores2) not a family drama, really, but more like a lack of family drama, because these people don't really care for each other all that much3) created to hurt my feelings, specifically, because i am an eldest sister and this entire thing is from page 1 to page 897 (estimating) anti-eldest propaganda.this is a book about 4 sisters, and one of them decides there's been a rift in the family and she is going to leave forever. that is the entirety of the plot, if i'm honest. which is fine. i'm all for no story, just vibes if i like the characters.but here is the thing...the eldest sister is evil, the sister we unexpectedly spend a lot of our time following goes from Having A Personality to simply just Being Nice, and the other two are kept pretty clearly out of our way in case we accidentally trip and fall into something happening. (don't worry. we essentially do not.)so i do not like the characters.and to all of this i say:sorry to the padavano sisters but i'm different. i have 3 siblings and i'm one of 3 sisters and there is just no way i would let any of this happen to us. and also...eldest sisters are not evil 2k23.all of the stakes in this are deeply made up, and could be overcome in about a half a second if any of these people had even a passing interest in each other, let alone the kind of all-consuming sisterly love we're told they do. but instead of doing what i like to do with my sisters, which is get drunk and watch twilight, they decide to be like \"i feel this made up trauma so much i want to pass it down from generation to generation.\"so sure. whatever. do what you want.but i don't have to like it!!!i mean, in actual fact there were moments of this i really liked. but there were also plenty of moments of this i really didn't, such as when i was forced to turn to my boyfriend while reading this (by force of lack of options while on a plane) and say \"oh. it's a cancer book.\"but at least i got to get some anger out while we sat on the tarmac.bottom line: i'm so glad you all loved this book so much, and also i have no idea what book you read.2.5-----------------------tbr reviewme at this cover(thanks to the publisher for the e-arc)",

      "review_text": "OUTLIER ALERT! Not quite my cup of tea! \ud83e\uded6 From the New York Times bestselling author of Dear Edward comes a poignant and engrossing family story that asks: Can love make a broken person whole?I have to be honest-this was almost a DNF for me. I picked it up and put it down, read another book, and picked it up again, hoping to have a better result the second time around. The beginning of this book was a slog to get through! William Waters grew up in a home devoid of love. He turned to basketball as an escape, and found he actually had the height and skills to earn himself a scholarship out of town. So much talk of basketball-not an engaging start for someone who isn\u2019t a fan. Injury would sideline him, but he will meet Julia Padavano in his freshman year of college, and she is a young lady who knows what she wants. She has decided that William will become her husband, and a Professor, and that she will provide him with the love and family he never had. Her three sisters also warmly embrace him, and for awhile he feels content. But, is it the kind of love that he needs? This is billed as a homage to Louisa May Alcott\u2019s Little Women, and without spoilers, you will find several themes from the timeless Classic, repeated here. I enjoy MOST homages, but this one opens in the late seventies/early eighties and YET-it STILL reads like a period piece from DECADES earlier, and that didn\u2019t feel authentic. Something will challenge the close bond that the sisters share, and something else will bring them full circle, but I never felt invested enough in this tale, to remain engaged in this 400 page, multi generational family saga. I did enjoy \u201cDear Edward\u201d but too much telling and not enough showing kept me from connecting emotionally with this one. And, perhaps, because I have read \u201cLittle Women\u201d, I was always a step ahead of what would happen\u2026But, I am in the minority. Perhaps it will work for you? 2.5 stars rounded up.AVAILABLE NOWThemes of depression, attempted suicide, terminal illness and familial bonds are thoughtfully explored.Thank You to Dial Press for inviting me to read this! A gifted copy was provided through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",

      "review_text": "I made it to 50% before throwing in the towel. I loved the author\u2019s book, Dear Edward, but this one failed to keep my interest and I found it strange and weird.It was depressing and slow, with unlikable characters. None of these factors alone is a deal breaker, but combined, it was the kiss of death. William is the only sympathetic character but I just couldn\u2019t slog through more of the story to find out what happens to him.For some reason the author wrote the story it as if it was set during the 1940\u2019s or \u201850\u2019s, not the 1980\u2019s, which created confusion. * I received a digital copy for review via NetGalley.

      "review_text": "Hello Beautiful is a big, emotional, heart wrenching family drama. It encompasses the Padavano family of four sisters and the broken young man who marries into the family. \u201cHello Beautiful\u201d is the greeting Charlie Padavano gives each of his daughters. \u201cCharlie had seen and loved each of them for who they were..the greeting was nice enough to make them want to leave the room and come in all over again.\u201d He might have been a bit of a drunk, but he was the tie that kept the family together. It was his unconditional love. Their mother Rose is a force of nature, but when a daughter disobeys the one condition Rose has placed on them all, a fracture occurs. As time goes on, more fractures occur. Napolitano has created a cast of characters that felt totally real. I\u2019m just like Julia, wanting a life that\u2019s mapped out and organized, but my heart went out to William and Sylvie. The sisters are meant to mirror the sisters in Little Women. Here again, the sisters have to find ways to be themselves within a close family setting. There are some important points made about independence and dealing with the expectations of others, especially family. But it\u2019s also about depression and the mistakes we make when we try to save those we love. I will admit to having tears rolling down my face for the final chapters of the book.

      "review_text": "So, here I sit in a bit of a conundrum. On the onset, given all the shining star reviews this one had, I thought I would feel the same glow. I didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t until I started the dreaded skim that it picked up -three quarters through. Napolatino, you took too long to get leverage. My expectations were sky high. This was my first with you and I felt a bit like a parachuter plummeting down -Until I got to page 300\u2026. This is a story about sisters. 4 of them. What pulls them together and what threatens to pull them apart.There were some eye rolling moments: \u2018contented in every cell of her body\u2019. Ok I get it. Do you need to point this out more than once? Less telling more showing please.Also the time period seemed off. This read as though it took place in the 60\u2019s rather than the 80\u2019s.Perhaps it didn\u2019t stand a chance on the heels of my last one that shook me. Or maybe I just had built this author up too much given all the hype.It could just be another case of it\u2019s me, not you\u2026It wouldn\u2019t be the first time. If you\u2019re up for a nice but slow story, then I can recommend. Do look to other reviews as they sparkle.3.5",

      "review_text": "3.5\u2b50William Waters attends Northwestern University in Chicago on a basketball scholarship, a welcome opportunity for him to leave his family and unhappy childhood in Newton, Massachusetts. Playing basketball, attending classes and the connections he makes with his friend Kent who works with him in the student laundry and his relationship with classmate Julia Padavano signal a new life for him. Marrying Julia and becoming a part of the Padavano family gives him a sense of belonging after a childhood spent with parents who never showed any affection or emotional attachment toward him after a tragic loss in the family that occurred when William was just a newborn. The basketball court was William\u2019s only refuge during those years. But the Padavanos \u2013 Julia, her parents and her three sisters Sylvie, Emeline and Cecelia welcome William into their family. Julia is ambitious and wants a life different from the one her mother had. She sees potential in William and steers him toward a life in academics. A series of injuries leads to William giving up basketball. William initially welcomes Julia\u2019s guidance but as they embark on their new life together and welcome Alice their daughter into the world, William is gradually engulfed in a darkness that pushes him to end everything his new life has to offer. This triggers a shift in the dynamics within the Padavano family \u2013 the repercussions of which leave no one unaffected. A homage to Louisa May Alcott\u2019s Little Women (the book and characters are referenced by the sisters quite a few times throughout the novel) set in modern times (1960-2008) Hello Beautiful by Ann Napolitano is a beautifully \u2013written, engaging family drama. However, I would prefer to discuss this book on its individual merit instead of comparing it to one of my all-time favorite classics. This story revolves around themes of family, mental health, ambition and expectations. The author does an exceptional job of exploring the female characters in this story- the four sisters and their mother and their bond, their differences and their distinctive personalities. I found how the author describes Charlie\u2019s influence on his daughters\u2019 lives, even though not physically present for a large part of the story (the title of the novel is of particular significance in this regard). My heart broke for William and his struggles. William\u2019s storyline highlights the importance of communication, awareness and empathy for those struggling with mental health issues. Following the Padavano sisters and William through decades, this is a lengthy novel but the narrative flows easily between multiple perspectives rendering it an easy read. Relationships are complicated, family is complicated and more often than not we need to learn how and when to hold on and how to let go, giving one other the space to breathe and grow as an individual. The author carries the story well up until the end where the inconsistencies in the plot and character development become evident. While people can change and/or open their minds, accept and forgive, the ending of this story, bittersweet as it may be, is overly simplistic, too convenient and therefore, unconvincing. Overall, I did enjoy reading this novel but was a tad disappointed with the way the story is wrapped up.Many thanks to author Ann Napolitano, Random House Publishing Group and NetGalley for the digital review copy.

This title left me a little disappointed. I do like a slow burn but this book was way too slow for my liking, especially the beginning. I will also say this took me four days to read and that is saying something coming from one who devours books. I almost did not finish it but decided to persist. It did get better. I am surprised I didn't like it more because this is Ann Napolitano's version of Little Women and that is one of my favourite books. This one had a soap opera feel to it.I liked that the book deals with issues of mental health in a realistic way and I felt for William, but I had trouble connecting to any of the characters other than feeling bad for them I felt nothing else. I did like that William found the strength to fight his demons. This is a very character-driven story and when you don't connect with the characters in any way it makes it a slog to get through. I think part of the problem was William's basketball playing didn't interest me at all.As much as I think that Napolitano is a beautiful writer this one just didn't do much for me. 2.5 stars rounded up.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.",

      "review_text": "Is it just me? I'm baffled by the hype surrounding this book. The characters seem pretty wooden to me \u2013 I can't really distinguish the twins from each other, and I feel pretty much the same about Sylvie and Julia. I didn't buy the way William's parents ignored him throughout his childhood. Not because that would never happen, but because there's no evidence of it. I think that's because this book is all \"tell\" and no \"show\". How about a Christmas morning scene, or a chance to hear what's said between the parents when they sit at the kitchen table? They don't talk to him, okay, but do they talk to each other? Do they know any other people? Do the Padavanos know any other people for that matter? When Cecelia gets pregnant, does the baby's father know? How do people in the neighborhood react? We don't know, because there really are no other people. The only friend any of the main characters has is Kent, who appears to have no life aside from supporting William. (I was stunned when the author drops in the detail that his seemingly perfect marriage had ended - what?) What does Julia do for work exactly? We're told Julia and Cecelia sometimes go on dates on Saturday nights. I'd like to see that, but no luck. Who are they dating, and where are they going? Do any of these dates lead to relationships, short or long term? Is sex happening? It's like the Mary Tyler Moore show, without the laughs. Ms. Napolitano is very accomplished, and maybe I'd feel differently about her other books. But this one's leaving me confused, frustrated, and honestly bored.",

      "review_text": "After Dear Edward, Ann Napolitano writes a beautifully tender family drama with its echoes of the classic Little Women, primarily set in Chicago. William Waters grows up in silence with parents unable to love or even look at him after the tragic loss of his sister Caroline. As a youngster, he plays basketball alone, until he is surprised to be encouraged to join local basketball players. It is his remarkable skills in the game that are responsible for him gaining a scholarship to college in Chicago, leaving a home he will never return to. William works in the laundry, which is where he cements a lifelong friendship with Kent, and it is in his history class where he meets the vibrant problem solver, Julia Padavano, who zeroes in on him as her future, a man she can mould into everything she desires.It becomes clear to William right at the start that Julia comes with her poor, but loving, loyal and chaotic Italian American family, her heart beats as one with her sisters, the literary dreamer, Sylvie, working at a library where she kisses boys, and the twins, the artistic Cecilia and Emeline, who takes care of them all. William is grateful to be wrapped into the heart of the Padavano family, the paper factory worker, the loving and drinking father, Charlie, and the gardening mother, Rose, with her love and resentment of an unambitious husband that powers her desire to see all her daughters attend college. However, marriage puts pressures and strains that push William beyond his capacity to cope as he moves further and further from who he is, whilst the Padavanos experience the kind of losses, surprises and betrayal that threaten to splinter the family apart, will the family ever come together again?Napolitano writes a extraordinarily moving and gripping family drama, creating a captivating and distinct set of Padavano sisters, all strong in their different ways, but challenged when cracks begin to appear in their unity. As for William, I felt my heart truly feel for him, a past responsible for the mental health issues he must face and find the inner strength to learn to put himself back together in a manner that is true to who he is, and despite the obstacles, learn to accept real love into his life. At the end, we can see with joy just how much he is loved by so many. This is sublime storytelling, of life, loss and love in all its different forms, the beauty and price of love, and illustrating the many problematic issues that can potentially undermine family cohesion. An absolute delight of a read that I recommend highly. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.",

Their lives lacked depth and I only could only get to know them on the very basic of levels. I just simply couldn't get invested in their troubles.

      "review_text": "\u201cWhat is wrong with this family?\u201d asks one of the characters close to the end of this affecting and emotional family drama. I could give my thoughts on that perhaps, now that I\u2019ve read it. But this is a family you need to discover and come to know for yourself, so that like me, at the very end of it, you might cry a little and think about all that was so very right about this family.William Waters is alone, shunned by his parents after a tragedy, and as a child lives as an outcast in his own home until in college when he falls in love with Julia Padavano . The course of his life is forever changed as he becomes part of her very close family. He thinks they are perfect, the loving family that he never had as he sees the seemingly unbreakable bonds between Julia and her three sisters. The story is realistic, though. Families aren\u2019t perfect no matter how much love there is. People are flawed. Life can get messy and sad and complicated and heartbreaking when these characters struggle with loss, grief, mental illness. Napolitano does such an extraordinary job of letting us know who these characters are through their own narrative and through how they see each other. There is a lot of sadness here and there were times when I thought this is just way too sad . I never thought of putting it down, though, as I was so into the lives of these characters and had to find out whether there could be healing and forgiveness. I won\u2019t spoil it by giving more details, but suffice it say that the depth of love in this family eased a little of my heartbreak. I\u2019m happy that Diane and I are back reading together again. It\u2019s doing wonders getting me out of my reading slump.I received a copy of this book from Random House through NetGalley.",

      "review_text": "I take it all back \u2013 my criticism of Dear Edward and my bafflement over the widespread love for it, both of which I expressed back in 2020 when I wrote my three-star review.Just kidding. I will forever and always stand by my Dear Edward review, so what if it ticked a lot of people off.And even though I still, to this day, will never understand the hype surrounding Dear Edward, I am now thrilled to say the exact opposite in regard to Napolitano\u2019s latest novel, Hello Beautiful:I get the hype. And it is well deserved.Because the book knocked my socks off. It\u2019s as if Napolitano took all that I didn\u2019t like about Dear Edward and fixed it, with the end result being one big, beautiful, glorious family drama.Inspired by Little Women, a most favorite novel of mine, Hello Beautiful is a moving portrait of the Padavano family, made up of four sisters and a man named William Waters, the husband of the the eldest sister, Julia. Napolitano chronicles their lives over a span of more than 40 years, giving the reader an insightful exploration of what it takes to make, and break, a family.Napolitano didn\u2019t so much as write this novel as she did craft it. Every sentence is exquisite in its composition; the plotting is airtight; the characterization is complex; every page is imbued with emotion. I lived and breathed the Padavano family while I read, and I am so sad to say goodbye to these remarkable characters.All the stars, and then some, for Hello Beautiful. I could not have loved it more.And if you don\u2019t want to take my word for how great the book is, take Oprah\u2019s. Napolitano\u2019s novel is her 100th Book Club pick.Good choice, Oprah.My sincerest appreciation to Ann Napolitano, Random House Publishing Group \u2013 The Dial Press, and NetGalley for the Advance Review Copy.

      "review_text": "This book was only 400 pages but it felt much, much longer. A tale centred around the Padavano Sisters, who seemed to like comparing themselves to Little Women, and their endless dramas, there were several points where I thought the book could have finished (and did think it was finishing until I saw the percentage read and sighed) and been good but it dragged on and on and on like a monotonous Zoom meeting. Not sure that was the aim was but it killed me. This was not a \u2018slow burn\u2019 either. The language used by the sisters confused me to what era they were living in, I kept thinking this was around the 50s whereas it was actually much later. It will be enjoyed by people who like a sedate, long rambling, never ending reads but for me, who likes to keep the brain ticking over with occasional excitement and revelation, it was a dud. #netgalley #arc",

      "review_text": "3 1/2 stars, rounded down. Hello Beautiful is a tribute to Little Women in that it revolves around four Chicago sisters who are very close as children. Their father, Charlie Padavano, would always greet each of them with \"Hello Beautiful!\" when they entered the room. Charlie was loved by everyone who knew him, except his wife who was always disappointed in his lack of success. Julia, the eldest, is described as her father's \"rocket\" who is destined to go places. She is very much like their mother, who can be distant. Sylvie, only a year younger than Julia, is more like her father. Emmeline, the nurturer, and Cecilia, the artist, are twins. The four women seem to move in a group at times since they are so interconnected.In college, Julia falls in love with a basketball player named William Waters. William's parents were very broken after the death of their daughter. They never loved William and he grew up isolated and alone, with basketball his only refuge. William is thrilled to be taken in by the whirlwind that is the Padavano family. Tragedy strikes, not once but twice, causing a rift. In the end, just as in Little Women, one of the sisters learns she is dying. Will that be enough to heal the deeply wounded family? I mostly enjoyed this story, but I never fully connected with the characters, especially Julia and William. When I rate something 3 stars, it doesn't mean I didn't like it, just that I didn't love it. I would be hesitant to recommend it, but I think I will be an outlier on this.",

      "review_text": "This is a novel about family and emotions, and what happens when people suppress their emotions or don't know how to deal with their emotions. Most of characters in this novel having big emotions, but they're conveyed to the reader in such a way as to be very flat, very placid. There's never a sense of urgency--not even when William goes missing, not even when he and Sylvia come clean to her sisters. It's just \"They were upset but then they weren't.\" or \"She was angry but made herself be calm and got on with her life.\" It's all just very smooth: things happen, the author tells us how they react, another thing happens. Even when there's character interiority, it's all on one very flat, very even reportage-style presentation. And so the characters lack a lot of depth. The setting is the same: Pilsen is a vibrant, interesting place in Chicago to have the characters live, but aside from the murals, there is absolutely no sense of place or what the neighborhood is really like. Again, it's flattened out into a kind of nothingness. This was a disappointment.",

      "review_text": "4 to 5 stars.The author of the outstanding Dear Edward now presents us with an epic and profoundly moving family drama spanning a 30 year period. William Waters grows up in silence and the lack of any attention from his parents who are broken by a tragedy. Unsurprisingly he\u2019s a loner but finds solace in basketball and he becomes a skilful player, earning himself a scholarship to college in Chicago. There he meets Julia Padavano, a personality about as far removed from quiet, self-contained William as it\u2019s possible to get. He meets the Padavano siblings, there\u2019s Sylvie, a year or so younger than Julia and twins, Emeline and Cecelia. William has finally found a girlfriend, a new family and a loyal friend in fellow student Kent. Julia is determined that she and William will build a future together. Can William finally find love, comfort, and the stability he has thus far been denied ?This novel does take me a little while to get into but the characters are so wonderfully conveyed that they burrow their way under your skin! The Padavano household is a colourful affair in the Chicago suburb of Pilsen whose art and culture the siblings become immersed in and is central to much of the drama. This is a beautifully written incisive character driven study of fascinating and diverse people and is a slow-moving \u201cMississippi\u201c read but the pace perfectly matches the in-depth study. The standout character for me is Sylvie who I love but obviously also William who you want to wrap in a warm embrace. The dialogue is smart too and makes you feel what the characters do. There are some lovely expressions and beautiful and original ways of describing things.The novel charms you, makes you angry in some places on characters behalf also unbearably sad at times as it\u2019s such an emotional puller on the heart strings and you want to remove heavyweights being carried. I love the ending and you feel as if you have been on one heck of a journey.I love how the title comes about and in most cases it is a case of hello beautiful inside and out. I also really enjoy the Little Women references and the inclusion of Walt Whitman.If you like character driven novels then this is for you. Highly recommended. With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Penguin General U.K. for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.",

But it doesn\u2019t matter because HELLO BEAUTIFUL is unforgettable: among the most moving books I\u2019ve read in the last year or two (and I\u2019ve read a lot of books that, as we like to say, gave me \u201call the feels\u201d). I know the book is a re-imagining of sorts of LITTLE WOMEN, a novel I treasure, but I found Ann Napolitano\u2019s remarkable novel deeper and more profound: a far more nuanced exploration of love and the ties that bind. Moreover, it also explores the nature of forgiveness and the toxicity of a grudge in a way that Louisa May Alcott, as much as I love what she gave us, never did. If you haven\u2019t read this gem, please do. You\u2019ll devour it.",

      "review_text": "Well, Hello, Beautiful story. I have one excellent book hanger with some sadness over leaving the fictional world of William and the Padavano Sisters. I find myself staring off into space, thinking about them and their lives. Ann Napolitano has written something beautiful and created something special with this tender, emotionally layered, honest portrayal of the human spirit and connections. She captures the up and downs of four vibrant and relatable sisters; however, the story centers around William, who seeks refuge with the sisters. He has grown up quite differently than they have. After losing his newborn sister, the grief paralyzed his parents, leaving them unable and unwilling to give William love and attention. This isn't your typical story that explores the loving bond of sisters; Ann Napolitano captures those up and downs, showing us a complicated, honest version of sisterhood with love, hurt, and betrayal. At first, they are inseparable, but as they grow older, they become their own person, pursuing what they want out of life while still being connected out of love and support. Themes of loyalty and separation, memories and grief, forgiveness and forgetting, kindness and resilience, marriage and parenting are explored, and Ann Napolitano gets to the core of the truth of human connection, whether we admit it or not. \"We hardly ever ask each other how we've been hurt.\"The pace is slow and quiet, and it took me a couple of chapters to slow my mind down enough to absorb the meaning of the beautiful words written, making this a great one for deep reading. Once I did, I was drawn into the characters' lives, and I could relate to William's need for basketball as I do with books for comfort and company. \"We look out the window, into ourselves for something more\"\"Sometimes words were like pebbles thrown against a window, and what she was reaching for was the window itself.\"I loved how grief was explored through the loss of the sister's father, whose memory and influence are constant in their lives. They hear his voice greeting them, \"Hello, Beautiful,\" Their happy memory of him guides them through their grief, bringing them comfort and peace. \"We're all part of something, all interconnected. When you see that, you see how beautiful life is.\"\"We are not contained between our hats and boots.\"At first glance, this might seem like a comparison to Little Women; however, it is the sisters who compare themselves to the characters in Little Women, and while they each have those stereotypes, the bossy one, the bookish one, the artsy one and the sensitive caring one, Ann Napolitano breathes new life into the classic by giving the sisters their own identities separate from each other with their own conflicts and growth. \"It's hard for me to accept the fact that we don't choose who we love, because who you love changes everything.\" I received a copy from the publisher on NetGalley",

      "review_text": "A story of family, or families, and how they mold who we become. This story revolves around the Padavno family, which includes a father, mother and four sisters, as well as a young man, William Waters, whose life has been very different from the lives of these four sisters. William was born into a family that included a mother, father and a three-year-old sister, but he has no real memories of her since she died before he had lived even a full week. It affected his life in ways that shaped him, cloaked him in an aura of despair inside his home, which shaped his life as he grew to realize that for his parents he was just a reminder of what they had lost. He managed to cope with this lack of affection by directing his need for some level of positive attention through his love of basketball. There, he feels accepted. When he meets Julia and then her family, it\u2019s the first time he feels as though he is being accepted for himself. He is pulled into the family\u2019s love for one another, Julia and her three sisters who seem a bit reminiscent of Alcott\u2019s March sisters, and their loving bond, despite how different they are from one another. William and Julia marry, which seems driven by Julia\u2019s vision for their future, only to come to a relatively quick ending, but in the meantime they have brought a baby girl into this world. William struggles with depression, feeling he can only bring unhappiness to his wife and his new daughter, and so he leaves them behind. This is also a story of the challenges of mental health issues, and how they affect not only the person with those challenges, but those they love. The accompanying shame some have in facing those challenges or even acknowledging them, and how it shapes the lives of all involved. And, perhaps, most important of all, this is a portrait of family, a story of loyalty, regrets, loss, and most of all, love.Pub Date: 14 Mar 2023Many thanks for the ARC provided by Random House Publishing Group - Random House, The Dial Press",

      "review_text": "I Loved Hello Beautiful \u2014 William Waters was raised in a house consumed by tragedy and distance. When he meets Julia Padavano as a freshman at Northwestern University, he is fascinated by her family, a loud and close group, who quickly welcome him into their tight knit crew. Julia is 1 of 4 sisters \u2014 She is a planner and a doer, Sylvie a reader and writer, Cecilia an artist, and Emeline a nurturer. While William observes the sisters\u2019 unwavering loyalty and bonds with each other, his starkly different past looms, threatening to destroy the carefully laid plans Julia has prepared for their future. As William confronts his struggles, each of the Padavano sisters face their own challenges too. Hello Beautiful  is a family saga about love, loss, and the unexpected turns in life. A few plot elements were predictable though this did not impact my enjoyment. Basketball plays a part in the story, which as a huge fan, was a welcome addition. After loving Dear Edward by Ann Napolitano, my anticipation of this book was high. The story spans many years, with several POVs, and I liked all of it.",

It\u2019s Oprah\u2019s 100th Book Club pick, a @bookofthemonth selection, the latest #notyomamasbookclub pick, and an Amazon Best of the month pick.You really don\u2019t need me to weigh in at this point as to whether you should read this sprawling family drama.What you need is a WARNING to stay the hell away from Ann Napolitano books!!If you crave emotional stability.If you would like to avoid devastating catharsis.If you prefer your characters surface level and your stories simple.If you need to save money on Kleenex.If you would like to go to bed at a reasonable hour.Then I am begging you: avoid Ann Napolitano and the tear-stained plague she hath wrought upon us.After reading Ann\u2019s previous book, JBC TOP 10 (2020) pick DEAR EDWARD, you would think I had learned my lesson. Here I am believing there's no way Ms. Napolitano could possibly inflict any additional devastation upon me.Book Friends: I WAS WRONG. I mean, just read this passage:\u201cLook,\u201d [he] said, desperate now. \u201cThere must be other guys. Find another guy. Keep looking.\u201d\u201cThere is no other guy\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re the one.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d He meant all of it: this moment, this woman in front of him, her hand in his, because she had crossed the room, and was holding his hand now. Warmth rushed through him.\u201cWell I do,\u201d\u2026[a]nd she leaned forward and kissed him.Are you kidding me, Ann Napolitano!? Do you enjoy this?I bet Ann gleefully wrote that passage. She probably closed her laptop afterwards and ordered chicken fingers on Postmates to celebrate another successful day of writing and wreaking inevitable heart-rending havoc on her readers, and didn't think twice about lighting a literary match and personally burning my GD house of emotions down to the studs.\"Would you like honey mustard or ranch with those?\"\"No thanks\", said Ann Napolitano. \"My dipping sauce of choice is my readers' tears.\"So There you go. Take all my stars, my sanity, my tears...my tendies. This book is brilliant, Ann Napolitano.As for the rest of you...well, you've been warned.",

      "review_text": "\u2728\u2728Happy Publication Day\u2728\u2728I just got an email from the the publisher: Hello Beautiful is an Oprah Book Club Pick!Hello Beautiful is a fascinating, stunning story of family, love, and the life we ultimately choose to live--not simply follow. We are introduced to the young, William Waters, a lonely boy finding meaning in his passion for basketball. William is born into a home devoid of emotion. He loses the only sibling, he never knew, a sister. HIs parents are absent, uninterested, but thankfully, he finds basketball as a reprieve. When he gets a college scholarship in Chicago, he never turns back. While at college, William meets Julia Padavano. Julia is assertive, a go-getter, and she has her entire life planned. She also comes with a family of three sisters that are thick as thieves. Her mother, often overbearing, has a strong presence, her father a loving nature. Julia's family is nothing like William's and it changes his entire outlook.Julia and William marry and have a daughter. Things seem to be going fine until they are not. Hello Beautiful is a story the deals with mental health in a way that is surprising and insightful. Often, character driven plots don't delve into life changing events made by characters while in a moment of emotional and mental struggle. When William decides to change the course of his life, not only is Julia and baby Alice affected, but all of the family, especially the sisters. The betrayal the heartache is unforgivable. The sisters often make references to Little Women and attach themselves to different characters throughout the book, which was endearing. Without giving too much of the plot away, Ann Napolitano is a gifted story-teller. I loved her previous novel, Dear Edward as well. Napolitano weaves the story in such a way that the sad moments have meaning and power, like the circle of life. The story also shines a bright light on sibling relationships from beginning to end. This is my second book of 2023, and I must say I cried my heart out. There were some parallels to gut-wrenching moments in 2022 that came to life in this book. The coincidence felt like the universe was speaking to me, and I felt grateful. I will hold this beautifully crafted story close to my heart. I also loved the setting, Chicago, a place I call home. A story is perfect when the reader is cheering for the characters, even the ones that make bad decisions. The character arcs were drawn perfectly and drove the story forward. This book will make you ache, it will make you cry, but it will also give you peace and a make you smile. 5/5 shining stars.I am enormously grateful to Netgally and Random House Publishing Group/Dial Press for sharing this stunning story with me in exchange for my honest review.See other reviews:Dear Edward",

I just love a book with intricacies that is still done in a simple writing form. There were many deep issues that could be dissected for years in this one and I felt everything kept winding in a way I didn\u2019t expect throughout the book. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know what to expect at all even after reading the description and unpredictability is always great in a book. There is always this feeling of \u201cHow dare you?\u201d when a book makes me cry, especially with this one since I didn\u2019t even like the characters. The characters as people sucked! But the characters as characters were written so well. I feel like I could easily describe them if I ever were to talk about them, mainly Julia, Sylvie, and William. To my comment about them sucking as people, I get the sense that that wasn\u2019t the intention of the book. We are given a chance here to read about the complicatedness of family and also the demons that everyone has. I loved the bond that the sisters had and the complicatedness of their relationship throughout the book, but when I think about it, this one is about really about William and everyone is just living in his world. Honestly, I consider him the villain of the story which I feel bad for saying because what he went through mentally was real, and I really did feel sorry for him. I am just personally not a fan of feeling like people get to get away with things because of their health or emotional state. Also, this constant \u201cI have no choice\u201d gets really annoying after a while. Again, great book and great writing but not so great characters or great events! I would still recommend!!",

So much that I read it in the same day.The writing is terrific! I was swept away by the prose throughout this book.I loved this story which contains great character development.It\u2019s a terrific contemporary drama, a family saga that covers the years between 1960 and 2008, with some very touching scenes.As I loved \u201cDear Edward\u201d (but I have not yet watched the adaptation for the screen), I was very excited when I heard that Oprah picked this book for her book club.It\u2019s way better than \u201cDear Edward\u201d, so if you were disappointed with that book, and if you like well developed drama, give this one a chance.I also purchased the audiobook, which I played simultaneously as I read the book. It was a terrific experience. I could have requested a copy from the library, but the waiting period was too long.Now I feel motivated to read \u201cLittle Women\u201d, by Louisa May Alcott (yes, I have never read that book, even though I have a couple of editions sitting somewhere).Hardcover (Random House Publishing Group): 400 pages (11-12 hours read)ebook (Kobo): 445 pages (default), 138k wordsAudiobook narrated by Maura Tierney: 15.1 hours (at normal speed)",

The twins bounced back and forth between Meg and Amy, but it was the ill-fated Beth whom they referred to when they were having a bad day.\u201c 'One of us will be the first to die,\u2019 they would take turns telling one another, and all four girls shuddered at the thought.\u201dWilliam Waters is a tall, sandy-haired basketball player Julia meets at college, and he is nearly overwhelmed when he sees the sisters for the first time, after a game.\u201cAfter the game\u2014the Wildcats won, and William had played his best minutes of the early season\u2014he climbed into the bleachers to see Julia. Only when he got closer did he see that she was seated with three girls who resembled her. They all had the same boisterous shoulder-length curls. \u2018These are my sisters,\u2019 Julia said. \u2018I brought them to scout you. That\u2019s basketball language, right?\u2019\u201dThese lively, shorter young women with the dark curly hair become his adopted family. His own parents had ignored him, such that he might as well have been an orphan.These are the main characters, they and the girls\u2019 parents, friends, and classmates. The book takes them from school age to middle age, from 1960 to 2008, with all the jubilation and tragedy we are led to expect from the publicity. Although parts of it are moving, it didn\u2019t engage me much with any of the individuals. I couldn\u2019t figure out what was missing until suddenly, halfway through, I realised that I felt I was being told a story but wasn\u2019t really being shown who anyone was. It was more like a summary (albeit a very long, sometimes repetitive one) of the events of those years.We are told, often, that their mother, Rose, is prickly, but that their sense of self-worth and confidence comes from their father, Charlie.  \u201cCharlie had seen and loved each of them for who they were. When any of his girls\u2014including Rose\u2014had come into view, he\u2019d always given them the same welcome, calling out, \u2018Hello beautiful!\u2019 The greeting was nice enough to make them want to leave the room and come in all over again.\u201dI like that each chapter begins with a character\u2019s name and the time period it covers, so we know whose point of view we\u2019re seeing. I just didn\u2019t connect with anyone enough to care. I may be alone in feeling this book was telling, not showing, or perhaps I\u2019m describing my reaction badly. It is a good story, and I was interested enough to read to the end. There well be many fans for this one, so be sure to read other reviews. \ud83d\ude0aThanks to NetGalley and Random House for the copy for review.",

Oh and she hugs and kisses him, buys him gifts and plans on spending the weekend with him. This is the kind of behavior that would get someone fired or arrested. Never mind the emotional damage of making promises she can\u2019t possibly keep to an already traumatized kid. She has no money, no car, credit card debt and shares an apt with roommates who are just as irresponsible as her. One scene, which was supposed to be funny (but was not) involves her pothead roommate who doesn\u2019t take care of basic hygiene needs. She resents her sister for getting more attention than her when they were kids. Never mind that her sister was severely ill. Grow up, or see a therapist. I know it\u2019s fiction, but this is too much for me and except for the creepy themes, it reads very YA. Does the world really need an adult Willie Wonka? No it does not. I\u2019m not even sure we need a children\u2019s Willie Wonka, a story I find creepy. I don\u2019t find it or this charming in the least.",

This book does an incredible job of balancing a whimsical and magical tone while still having depth and going into the hardships of the main characters. This book felt like a love letter to reading, especially to children's books as one of the characters is a famous children's author. Part of the book also takes place on Clock island which was such a magical setting. If you're a fan of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate factory, this is a must read.",

      "review_text": "I'm really perplexed by the rave reviews this novel is receiving... I picked it as my Book of the Month primarily because it mentioned Maine (where I'm from), but also because the premise was promising: a beloved children's book author comes out of semi-retirement to write one last book and invites his four most ardent fans to compete for a chance to win the only copy of it. One of these fans, Lucy, is now a 26-year-old kindergarten teacher's aide living in poverty: she has 3 college-aged roommates who frequently smoke and drink, no car, loads of debt, and an unhealthy obsession with adopting one of her former students, a 7-year-old orphan named Christopher. Despite being told by social services that she is not in any position to foster or adopt any child (and it's true - she's really not; she laments at length about how she doesn't have the money for a $15 gift for Christopher, let alone money to feed, clothe, transport, or take care of him), she continues to call herself his mother and insist that his current foster family where he is fed and clothed and looked after is not as good as living with her would be. And in a big ole cringefest to teachers everywhere, she frequently hugs, kisses, and touches Christopher when they are alone together at school; nothing sexual happens, but still, no teacher in their right mind would put themselves in a situation like that today. Anyway, she is determined to win this contest and sell the book to the highest bidder so that she can finally put all of her haters to shame and adopt Christopher.This book was just so... boring. I didn't really care about any of the characters. Lucy was whiny and immature and incredibly traumatized by her childhood. I don't want to minimize the pain of parental neglect, but her parents neglected her as they focused their attention on their sick older child. Lucy went to stay with her grandparents, and it somehow ballooned into this whole \"nobody loves me and my childhood was the worst ever and it was totally my sick older sister's fault\" thing that didn't seem believable to me. When Lucy and her sister finally interacted, there was no tension, no heat, no real conflict; it felt like they were both reading a script. I just didn't care. Lucy needs therapy.The children's author Jack was supposed to be endearing, I think, but he came across as creepy to me. He was a gay man who wanted to be a father at a time when that wasn't a possibility, so I have a lot of sympathy for him, but the fact that so many children wrote letters to him about how miserable their lives were and he wrote them all back saying how he would be a better father to them than their own parents and how he wished they'd all come live with him? Ick. And the fact that one of these children DIED on her way to be rescued by him? And he was able to silence the story by paying people off? NOPE. Absolutely not.The romance was meh but was made worse by the fact that the two characters met once before, when she was only 13 and he was in his mid-20s. Nothing happened then, other than her having a bit of a crush on this cute guy, but still. We also learn that this female character had a lengthy and abusive relationship with a man in his late 30s when she was in her late teens-early 20s. Both of these \"romances,\" put in the context of all of the inappropriate interactions between children and adults in this book, feel icky at best.Then there's the game itself, which didn't come in until at least halfway through the book. It was boring. The few games that were actually described were riddles easily solved by one of the characters. The rest of the games were just named in passing without any scenes. I thought this book was going to be all about the game, but it was really all about emotional trauma and believing in the power of your dreams and facing your fears and blah blah blah.The writing overall is juvenile and simplistic. While this is not a problem in and of itself, this is also apparently NOT a YA novel, which makes the writing a problem for me. The whole thing needs more revision, more eyes on it, and more development before it will be ready for adult audiences, or it needs to be revised and rebranded for young adults. It just didn't work for me. 1.5 stars.",

Twenty-six-year-old Lucy Hart, remembers the time she ran away from home at the age of thirteen to meet Jack Masterson, a famous children\u2019s book author whose Clock Island series captured the hearts and imagination of generations of readers. She did meet the author, though her plans to stay with him didn\u2019t quite pan out. The series remains her favorite and she shares that love with seven-year-old Christopher a student of hers, recently orphaned and now in foster care. Lucy carries the pain of an unhappy childhood and cares deeply for Christopher. She dreams of becoming his foster parent and eventually adopting him. However, her meager income as a teacher\u2019s aide and less than suitable living arrangements make her an unsuitable candidate for the same. When her favorite author invites her to participate in a contest to win the only copy of his new manuscript, written after an almost six-year hiatus, Lucy jumps at the opportunity to visit Clock Island, Masterson's private island in Maine that is modeled after the setting for his books. Not only is she excited to meet her favorite author once again but winning the contest would greatly improve Lucy\u2019s financial situation and thus, her chances of being approved as a guardian for Christopher.\u201cWhat did the kids in the books have to do to get their wishes? First, they had to make a wish. Then they had to get to Clock Island. After that, they answered riddles or played strange games. Then they had to face their fears.\u201dOn Clock Island, Lucy meets her co-contestants \u2013 three others like herself who had once run away from unhappy situations at home when they were children to meet \u201cThe Mastermind\u201d who they believed had the power to make their wishes come true. Now as adults, they are back at Clock Island and they all have their reasons for wanting to with the contest. Lucy also meets Hugo Reese again, the illustrator for the series. Jack\u2019s contest consists of a series of games and riddles and ultimately just like the characters in his books, a special challenge wherein they would have to face their fears. But news of Jack Masterson\u2019s new book is making waves and there are scheming lawyers, book collectors and publishers to get their hands on that coveted manuscript. Lucy has a lot on her plate \u2013dodging shady people with their shadier offers, her dynamic with Hugo, the stress of winning the contest and securing a future for Christopher and herself- and it\u2019s not going to be an easy ride.The Wishing Game by Meg Shaffer is a beautiful story. Remember Willy Wonka? Instead of a chocolate factory, here get to have a look at Masterson's \u201cwriting factory\u201d fully equipped with a huge collection of typewriters and his raven, Thurl Ravenscroft,also his \u201cco-writer\u201d. The narrative is shared for the most part from Lucy\u2019s perspective and a few chapters from that of Hugo with excepts from one of the Clock Island books interspersed throughout the narrative. Jack Masterson is a quirky character with a heart of gold. Lucy Hart is endearing and I was invested in her story from the very beginning. Her journey is one of catharsis and growth. The dynamics between the Jack and Hugo and Lucy and Christopher - the friendship, concern and empathy and sense of family will touch your heart. Christopher did seem a bit mature for his age but his reservations can be explained by the trauma he has endured. I also liked that the author also looks at the potential perils involved when impressionable minds are influenced to embark on risky ventures. Some moments will break your heart and others will have your heart singing with joy. Overall this a lovely story that touches on themes of family, childhood, loss, kindness, love and sacrifice. As an introvert who grew up with her nose always in a book (Enid Blyton books, The Trixie Belden series, and The Chronicles of Narnia were among my favorite childhood series) and an adult who struggles to keep from squealing with excitement every time she visits The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Disney World (I read the Harry Potter books when I was well into my twenties), I was captivated by this story and the idea of Clock Island as the reclusive author\u2019s not\u2014so\u2014humble abode. Meg Shaffer does a brilliant job of highlighting the role that books play in the lives of children (and adults) and the refuge they provide and in doing so reinforces the fact that books remain your constant companion through the darkest of times. Though not fantasy per se, this story is magical in its own way. Read this book with your heart and you won\u2019t be disappointed! Many thanks to author Meg Shaffer, Random House Publishing Group- Ballantine and NetGalley for the much-appreciated digital review copy. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. \u201cThe stories write us, you see. We read something that moves us, touches us, speaks to us and it \u2026 it changes us.\u201d",

Some of the storyline was too far-fetched if you ask me though and the people were toooooo nice!!!!\u201cThe only wishes ever granted are the wishes of brave children who keep on wishing even when it seems no one is listening because someone always is\u2026\u201dCute, adorable but predictable.",

      "review_text": "Just when I was starting to doubt I\u2019d get a second 5-star read this year, Meg Shaffer delivered the answer to my wish - the book version of a big, warm hug aptly titled The Wishing Game!Lucy is a 26-year-old kindergarten teacher\u2019s aide with little savings, no car, and three roommates, who - more than anything in the world - wants to adopt Christopher, a young student living with a foster family after losing his parents. Their bond is strong, but Lucy has just been told it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll ever qualify to adopt him. She\u2019s preparing to tell him this when hope arrives in the form of a little blue envelope. She recognizes who it\u2019s from since she received one just like it thirteen years ago.Across the country, on a whimsical clock-shaped island off the coast of Maine, renowned children\u2019s book author Jack Masterson, whose Clock Island series has been loved by millions has come out of a mysterious five-year silence to announce a contest that four lucky invitees will participate in for the rights to a brand new, singular copy of his newest Clock Island book. Those invitations were sent out in \u2026 you guessed it \u2026 little blue envelopes.Does that premise sound familiar? It should. It takes inspiration from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory where five children competed for Mr. Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory. The similarities end there, though. Contestants Lucy, Andre, Melanie and Dustin had all written to Jack as children hoping that, like The Mastermind character in his books, he could fix their painful home or school situations. As adults now, they\u2019ve overcome their childhoods, but each needs the money that selling the rights to Jack\u2019s book would bring.As all four gather at Clock Island, in Jack\u2019s impressively large home, they also meet his assistant and illustrator of his books - a 34-year-old world-weary, sarcastic, but completely lovable Brit, Hugo, who\u2019s been watching over Jack during his hard drinking writing exile. Hugo remembers Lucy as the thirteen-year-old girl who tried to run away to Clock Island once. She remembers how cute he was. I loved their fun, sweet interactions now that they\u2019re both adults!After days of Jack\u2019s games and maddening riddles, whose wish will come true? That\u2019s for you to read and find out! I did enjoy the (mostly) supportive nature between the contestants, and I love how things came together in the end. It was a little piece of perfection! There were some heavy themes like childhood trauma, parental neglect, alcoholism, bullying, running away and all forms of abuse, but it was never heavy-handed or depressing. Rather this story is a love letter to the power of books to change a reader\u2019s life and is so kind-hearted in its approach. The books that stand out to me and end up as my year-end favorite always have this in common: They make my heart happy. Plain and simple. Jack, Hugo, Lucy and Christopher all stole my heart and made this a new one for my favorites shelf. If you like whimsical books about books, found family, a bit of magical realism, romance (and great pet names like Vince Purraldi, Billie Pawliday, Darles Chickens, and Thurl Ravenscroft), I highly recommend this wonderful, well-written debut! Oh, and may I add ... best cover ever. \ud83d\ude0d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2764Thanks to Random House Publishing - Ballantine, NetGalley and author Meg Shaffer for this digital ARC to honestly review. It\u2019s due to be published May 30, 2023.",

      "review_text": "The Wishing Game by Meg Shaffer is a Book About Books!When Lucy Hart was a child, she found the love she lacked at home in books and her favorites were from the Clock Island series by children's author Jack Masterson.Lucy was so taken by these books that at age thirteen she ran away to Clock Island with the dream of living with her favorite author.Thirteen years later...Jack Masterson reappears to announce he's written a new book in the Clock Island series and will hold a contest on his private island where four hand-picked readers will compete to win the only copy, the manuscript.At age twenty-six, Lucy has a different dream now. When she's about to give up hope, she receives a blue envelope with news she'll be traveling to Clock Island as one of the four readers chosen to compete in the competition.This could be Lucy's chance of making her dream of a better future come true... My initial thought about The Wishing Game? It was slow and written for a younger reader and audience. My hope was the pace would pick-up and the writing would age-up as the story progressed. That's exactly what happens beginning with Part Three. The pace picks up, the story gets meatier, and becomes verifiably Women's Fiction through the remainder of the story. The Magical Realism was a bit sparse but the magic of the story and the island was definitely thick and mysterious. It has a great mix of characters but the story primarily focuses on Lucy, Jack, and Hugo who is Jack's illustrator and his right-hand for just about everything. The island and the Clock Island books feel like characters, too. This story stirs fond memories of those fun childhood experiences with books that lead your imagination into delightful free-fall. I recommend The Wishing Game to readers who enjoy a little magic, a little romance, and a little bit of YA in a Women's Fiction Book about Books! 3.75 stars rounded up!Thank you to NetGalley, Ballantine Books, and Meg Shaffer for an ARC of this book. It has been an honor to give my honest and voluntary review.",

      "review_text": "**Many thanks to NetGalley, Megan Whalen at Random House-Ballantine, and Meg Shaffer for an ARC of this book! Now available as of 5.30!**\nHold your breath. Make a wish. Count to three...\nCharming, whimsical, and heartfelt, this magical journey will take you out of the real world and deep into a land of Pure Imagination...and I'm not sure I've returned home just yet!All teachers feel a certain amount of love for their students, but 26 year old Kindergarten teacher Lucy Hart is on another level with one special child, Christopher Lamb. Christopher lost his parents tragically, and Lucy briefly got the chance to step in as his mom...and her heart never left. Living with two roommates and a strained financial situation, however, is holding her back from being able to adopt Christopher officially and wear the title of Mom for good. Despite this, the two share a magical bond, brought together by their love of wishes and magic, and also one special set of books: The Clock Island series, written by Jack Masterson.One day, Lucy shares a secret with Christopher; many years ago, she wrote a letter to Masterson, begging to be his sidekick (after her own parents left her unseen and unheard for too long) and Lucy actually VISITED Clock Island and knows that it is indeed real. More surprising still, Masterson has chosen THIS time to come out of reclusive retirement and hold a contest: the winner will receive the one and ONLY copy of the newest installment of the Clock Island series...worth SIX FIGURES, easily.Lucy knows that this book is her one and only shot at having the money to make her dream of motherhood come true, and she is determined to win. But when she arrives at Clock Island, her competitors possess equal resolve. Another familiar face also greets Lucy: that of Jack Masterson's Clock Island illustrator, Hugo, a slightly gruff but shockingly handsome Brit who has Lucy swooning (to herself, of course). With the stakes ever higher and Masterson's riddles becoming maddening, will Lucy's wish FINALLY come true? Or will all her future plans vanish like the rabbit in the magician's hat?With homages, things can go one of two ways: the result can feel like a rip off of the source material....OR, in the case of The Wishing Game, they can serve as a springboard for an equally iconic, memorable, and magical experience in storytelling. Shaffer lovingly dedicates this book to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (and the world Dahl created, by extension) and at first glance, this might seem like a series of repeated plot points. Eccentric genius of his craft disappears, and after a long hiatus runs a contest to let others into his personal sanctum, winner receives glory and of course, the BEST prize imaginable. And sure, this framework is present here, and Shaffer doesn't necessarily shy from it.What she does is even better. Shaffer leans into the parallel, but at the same time, forges her own unique path, rife with gentle nods to some of fiction's most beloved and timeless childhood tales. There is a certain indescribable magic in childhood: the world is big and endless, and ANYTHING can happen. As we grow, our worldview tends to get smaller, and we lose so much of this focus to the forced structure of society and the pressure to 'get things done.' But in this story, all of our adult characters (and ALL of them are adults, save for Christopher!) are the ones examining and overcoming the same fears first born in childhood. There are HEAVY topics explored in this one: everything from child abandonment, allegations of kidnapping, and the foster care system...and yet, as deep as this one goes, it has a certain buoyancy and whimsy that keeps even the darkest moments from feeling like a shadow. Part of this is due to the complex and LOVABLE characters Shaffer has created. Everyone from our MC Lucy to the mysterious Jack Masterson to the sensitive and multilayered illustrator Hugo shines, and as a reader, you can't help but be drawn to them. Though Masterson strays from the over-the-top silliness of Wonka, he has just enough of a grin in his words and a twinkle in his eyes to keep everyone guessing, and his 'writing factory' is the stuff of every bibliophile's dream (complete with Bird In Residence, Thurl Ravenscroft!)Though I am emotional to the core, I rarely find a read that makes me laugh OR cry...and this one handily did both. Multiple times. This is the sort of book that once you MANAGE to put it down, you will not be able to stop thinking about it. I actually told myself to slow down MULTIPLE times while reading because I was just aching to savor it. Much like childhood, once you realize how magical it can actually be, it's just about gone. There's just something about the books you read at a young age that stirs something inside you, no matter how many years it's been, and I feel the same way about books like Charlotte's Web: I enjoyed it at 8 and would still enjoy it at 80. The Wishing Game has this same sort of transcendent, ethereal quality: it shines in 2023 and will STILL shine in 2123...and beyond.One of my favorite reads of this year, and perhaps even the past few, The Wishing Game reminded me of the dedication at the beginning of the film adaptation of the Wizard of Oz: \n\"For nearly forty years this story has given faithful service to the Young in Heart; and Time has been powerless to put its kindly philosophy out of fashion. To those of you who have been faithful to it in return ...and to the Young in Heart ...we dedicate this picture.\"\nAnd if this book is any indication of the future Shaffer has in store, she could just be the next effortlessly timeless writer we have ALL been waiting to find...somewhere at the end of the rainbow. \ud83c\udf085 stars\nNominated for Best Debut and Best Fiction in the Goodreads Choice Awards! Now in paperback!!",

      "review_text": "3.5 Jack \u201cthe mastermind\u201d Masterson is the reclusive mega-bestselling children\u2019s author who wrote a series of books about the Magical, Mysterious \u201cClock Island\u201d.It\u2019s been years since he has published anything new, but he suddenly resurfaces with a brand-new book AND a one-of-a-kind competition, offering a prize that will change one winner\u2019s life. But, there is a catch-only four people will be invited to compete to win the \u201cone and only\u201d copy of the book, worth enough money to change a life forever. Lucy Hart, once a child who found solace in his books, and dreamed of being the author\u2019s \u201csidekick\u201d, knows that as a teacher\u2019s assistant, she doesn\u2019t have enough money to adopt the orphaned boy that she tutors-but winning the competition would allow her to do so. Can she find a way to be invited? That seven year old boy, Christopher, has also found comfort from the \u201cClock Island series\u201d which Lucy reads to him. The two play what they call, \u201cThe Wishing Game\u201d often. He WISHES to be her son. And, she WISHES to be his new mother.So when her invitation arrives, he screamed. And, she screamed. \u201cWhen you gotta scream, you gotta scream\u201d! Lucy heads to Clock Island, and Jack\u2019s \u201cwriting factory\u201d to play his games, and solve his RIDDLES with her eyes on the prize-you have to be brave for wishes to come true! From the opening dedication to \u201cCharlie, and all of us still looking for our golden tickets\u201d to the author\u2019s acknowledgement page, thanking Gene Wilder\u2019s Willy Wonka for taking over her brain in third grade-the book is VERY reminiscent of \u201cWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\u201d and Jack Masterson is VERY reminiscent of Willy Wonka himself. You could call this a \u201creimagining\u201d or a \u201chomage\u201d to the Classic but with books in place of chocolate, but BE AWARE, I felt it read like YA even though the characters are adults, and it hasn\u2019t been tagged as such. If you are young, or young at heart, you can pick up this charming book NOW!  I think a hardcover with this GORGEOUS COVER ART, would look wonderful on my shelf. A buddy read with DeAnn and MarilynW-be sure to watch for their \u201calways amazing\u201d reviews! Thank You to Ballantine Books for the gifted ARC provided through NetGalley. It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!",

This book will resonate with Harry Potter fans (which I am not) who enjoyed that series as a kid (my kid did)...They'll have lots in common with Lucy and her love of The Clock Island books. Many reviews have said this is more young adult fare but I didn't find it so. There is magic, romance and a difficult foster-to-adopt situation. Lucy also deals with having a limited income, so she does her job as a teaching assistant and supplements her income with her knitted scarves on Esty. I found those subjects a little too adult for this to be kids' fiction but I think kids could enjoy it too. Parts of this book broke my heart but it is ultimately a joyful story.This was a truly unique book, even though it has remnants of Willy Wonka, but with the kids coming back as adults! I loved the characters, it sucked me in right away and I read it in a couple of sittings making this book perfect for readers young and old.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.",

      "review_text": "2.5 Stars, rounding upGreat premise, but execution didn't really work for me.Jack Masterson is a famous children's series book writer about the Clock Island books. He lives on Clock Island and Lucy Hart as a 13 year old girl runs away from home to Clock Island to try to become the Mastermind's sidekick. Fast forward 20 years later, and Jack hasn't written a new book and starts a challenge for the winner to win the only copy of his latest installment in the Clock Island series. He invites four adults that had previously escaped to Clock Island that are all in desperate need of something. The challenges and riddles started out cool and interesting and quickly lost their luster. There were a few threads that I found extremely hard to believe, and I didn't really love the idea that the illustrator, Hugo Reese was interested in a 13 year old girl that comes back in her early 20s and that's the love story that we really didn't need, gave me minor ick vibes. I also really couldn't get behind Lucy being completely obsessed with this foster child, Christopher. The other thread that really bothered me was Lucy's family- her parents essentially throwing her out because they were obsessed with the health of her sister, Angie? This was a cutesy read that didn't really have any depth, even though the author tried to throw a spaghetti pot of \"hard topics\" at the wall, none of them stuck.Thank you to Netgalley and Ballantine Books for an advanced copy of this book in exchange for my honest review",

Who hasn't wanted to meet their favorite author and live out their childhood dream through a book? Everything spilled out as mythical but yet it was strangely real-life fantasy...if you can tie it all together. Jack Masterson is the author of The Clock Island series. A few incidences have occurred in his life which have put him in hiding and not writing anymore. His illustrator Hugo, a very handsome man, is tired of the isolation and being a companion watching over Jack for reasons that will appear near the end of the book. When Jack decides to write another book for the series, he also decides to have a contest so a winner will be able to make his/her life better. This is when 26 year old Lucy Hart comes into focus. Her life has been one of neglect and she spends her days as a teacher's aide to help other children. One particular 7 year old boy, Christopher, has lost his parents and was placed into foster care. Lucy wants to adopt him, but was not approved due to lack of funds and a home for him. She enters the contest because The Clock Series helped her through life and she has read them to Christopher to help him. She had run away from home to Clock Island when she was 13 years old hoping she could live there with the author and knows everything about the books. There are so many awakenings in the book! Each character has suffered a loss and lack of stability. With four potential winners chosen to come to the island for the contest, you will have so many moments of anticipation and hope for Lucy. This was a fun heartfelt book and sometimes tearful due to the plight each character has suffered, but the competition is about to begin. Do not miss out on your \"Wish\"!!!Thank you NetGalley and Penguin Random House for this ARC in exchange for my review!",

      "review_text": "In a Nutshell: \u2018Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2019 without the \u201cwonkiness\u201d. [Pun intended.] I loved this book almost till the end. A sweet and beautiful read that will warm the cockles of your heart despite some sappy elements. Story Synopsis:Six years ago came the last book in the long-running Clock Island series. Since then, children\u2019s book author Jack Masterson has stayed reclusive. Until now, when he has announced a brand-new Clock Island book and a special competition, offering the winner a mind-blowing prize.Lucy Hart has always been a huge fan of the Clock Island series and of its author. As a teacher\u2019s aide, the twenty-six year old shares her love of reading with her little charges, especially with seven year old Christopher, an orphaned child who loves his teacher more than anyone else. Lucy dreams of adopting Christopher, but her financial situation doesn\u2019t allow her to fulfil her dream.Masterson\u2019s competition seems like a dream come true, and all Lucy has to do is to win his competition. But as we all know, dreams go hand in hand with perils. The story comes to us in the limited third person perspective of mostly of Lucy and Hugo, Jack\u2019s illustrator.Bookish Yays:\ud83d\ude0d Though the story was quite straightforward and almost predictable, it was very tough to keep aside. The plot is a nice combination of emotional and heartwarming. \ud83d\ude0d As readers, what do we most love? Books! And when there are books about books, hallelujah! I simply loved the role books played in this plot, right from alleviating fears to providing imaginary escapes from tough situations to simply spreading joy and laughter. There were even some chapters that were written as \u201cexcerpts\u201d from Jack\u2019s Clock Island books. These were the perfect addition to the story. All the bookish elements were a bibliophile\u2019s delight. \ud83d\ude0d While I love the premise of Roald Dahl\u2019s \u2018Charlie and the Chocolate factory\u2019, Willy Wonka wasn\u2019t really my favourite character. So imagine a similar premise, where you get a \u2018golden ticket\u2019 to Clock Island, and weirdo Wonka is replaced by the masterful maverick Masterson. I simply loved Jack\u2019s character \u2013 he was the lynchpin of the plot in so many ways. Because we don\u2019t hear from his character directly, he gets maximum attention from us and just as the children in the book, we hang on to his every word.\ud83d\ude0d The remaining characters too were as goody-goody as expected in this plot. Lucy, though a tad too impulsive and impractical, had a heart of gold. Christopher is one of the cutest child characters I have ever read. I wish I could just hop into the book and hug him tight! And what can I say about Hugo Reese! The typical romantic coconut \u2013 hard exterior, soft interior. First time ever I saw a lead character with arm tattoos! The secondary characters are mostly cookie-cutter, but a few of them still make their presence felt. \ud83d\ude0d The titular \u2018wishing game\u2019 refers to multiple things in the plot, one of which is the game that Lucy and the other three contestants have to play to win Jack\u2019s prize. I enjoyed this game as well, with the riddles adding to the fun element.\ud83d\ude0d Through Christopher\u2019s story, we also get a look at the foster care system. Though the author has deliberately focussed only on hopeful elements, the book still offers a touching, albeit somewhat saddening glimpse of a system overloaded with needy children looking for care and love.\ud83d\ude0d There are several other dark and depressing themes, but most of these are mentioned in passing, thereby keeping the impact on the lighter side. This works well for the plot because the positive vibes would otherwise have been killed by the sombre elements.\ud83d\ude0d Clock Island is not just the name of the book series but also a location. And man, what a location it is! Right from the rooms in the main house to its various clock spots, the whole island seems like the perfect spot to live in. To top it all, the book has a map of the island at the start!\ud83d\ude0d While there are hints of attraction in the story, romance never takes centre stage, which remains firmly focussed on the personal development of the characters. This always works to my benefit as I hate insta-attraction stories.Bookish Nays:\ud83d\ude14 One particular writing choice towards the end disappointed me. That development simply wasn\u2019t needed, and it felt like a satisfactory track had been purposely manipulated to heighten the emotional shock. Cutting off that part from the book wouldn\u2019t have made any difference, or rather, would have improved the book. \ud83d\ude14 Certain elements in Lucy\u2019s backstory also felt farfetched. Her reason for staying away from certain people wasn\u2019t convincing. The big reveal in her arc reminded me of a Jodi Picoult book\u2014not revealing the name here as it is akin to a spoiler\u2014but it didn\u2019t come across realistically in this story.\ud83d\ude14 Just as in the Roald Dahl book, you know who will be the winner. So the proceedings are somewhat guessable. Then again, this genre thrives on a guaranteed HEA, and the HEA is delivered to our satisfaction. But a small part of me wishes it had explored the boundaries of predictability and even gone beyond.All in all, this was one of those books where you know how things will go but you still can't stop reading. The fast pacing also helped. Especially considering that this was a debut work, the author has handled it quite well. For most of the book, I was accompanied by my Shoulder Angel and my Shoulder Devil. Angel was going all gooey-eyed, laughing and crying along with the candy-sweet plot developments while Devil was rolling his (her?) eyes at the improbability of the mushiness and the predictability. Angel and I decided to ignore Devil and relish the read with all our heart. But the final couple of chapters proved Devil correct as the emotional manipulation went a step too far with the introduction of the unnecessary plot point. Thereafter, Devil convinced me to lower my rating to 4 stars even though Angel was comfortably perched on the 4.5 stars mark. 4.25 is a way of keeping them both happy.Recommended to those who would love to read a touching found-family style story with plenty of fun and emotional moments.4.25 stars.My thanks to Random House Publishing Group \u2013 Ballantine and NetGalley for the DRC of \u201cThe Wishing Game\u201d.

      "review_text": "\u201cHowever small the chance might be of striking lucky, the chance was there.\u201d - Ronald Dahl, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory \nJack Masterson, the author of the beloved Clock Island series, quit writing years ago without explanation. He had a huge fan base and children would write to him telling him their wishes. His beloved books were missed by all, but now he has a new book coming out! Imagine the excitement felt by fans worldwide when they learned about the new book. But there is a catch, isn't there always a catch? He is holding a contest at his home on the real clock island, and he is inviting a select few to participate. The winner will receive the one and only copy of the book!!!! woohoo.Lucy has loved the Clock Island series since she was eight years old. She even ran away once to Masterson's house on Clock Island hoping to be his sidekick. She has never lost her love of reading and works as a teacher's aide and wants nothing more than to adopt seven-year-old Christopher Lamb, who became an orphan after tragedy.Back on Clock Island, Lucy meets Jack Masterson and his assistant, Hugo. She also meets the other contestants, and the competition begins. Not only are they competition against each other, they must contend with a lurking attorney who wants to bribe contestants to sell the book to his client if they win.This was such a delightful book full of beautiful passages. I hung on to the words and as I was drawn into the story. I have been a bookworm since childhood and loved how the author showed the characters\u2019 love of books and how books take readers on journeys and have impacts on their lives. I also loved the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory feel. I watch Gene Wilder version every year. Reading this book was like a big warm hug. The book touches on family and what makes a family, love, wishes, generosity, kindness, books, facing your fears, dreams and finding your home. It was lovely, moving and thought provoking. I loved the characters and their backstories. There was so much heart in this book. Well written, moving, and hard to put down. 4.5 starsThank you to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

      "review_text": "It\u2019s shocking to me that this has such raving reviews despite the wildly inappropriate relationship depicted between a 26yo teacher\u2019s aide and a 7 yo orphaned boy. They have no connection outside of the fact that he was her student, yet she\u2019s obsessed with adopting him because she loves him the most. She puts him in her lap and cuddles and kisses him at school. It\u2019s creepy, gross, and I was uncomfortable reading it.She\u2019s completely unqualified to adopt any kid. No car, very little money, and living in an apartment with several college kids who drink and smoke. And yet she believes herself to be the best \u201cmother\u201d (her words, constantly) simply because she loves him the most (again, no connection outside the fact that he\u2019s her student). Not only that, but the other teacher agrees with her and thinks the kid\u2019s social worker is dumb by not allowing her to adopt? Absolutely not.The foster home she\u2019s trying to save him from is keeping him fed, clothed, safe in his own room, with no abuse whatsoever, but she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be there because the foster mother gives more attention to the two sick newborns she has. Which\u2026 yes\u2026 obviously\u2026It\u2019s similar to her trauma I guess, which is that she wasn\u2019t prioritised by her parents because they were always in the hospital with her chronically ill sister. Lord spare me.I think it tries to make a point about being a poor parent in the US, but it\u2019s so far off the mark I can\u2019t even laugh.DNF, absolutely would not recommend, and I\u2019m shocked that this has been glossed over by so many other reviewers.",

      "review_text": "\u201cTick-tock. Welcome to the Clock.\u201d\nHow I wish Clock Island existed in the real world, outside the pages of Meg Shaffer\u2019s debut novel, The Wishing Game. I\u2019d be on my way to Maine right about now, just so I could see it with my own eyes. My boys would be in tow; my husband, too \u2026 his complaints and all.I grew up loving Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, the original movie starring Gene Wilder, and later also loved Roald Dahl\u2019s classic book upon which the movie is based. Which is why it doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least that I adored Shaffer\u2019s whimsical tale of a magical contest on a fairy tale island and the woman, Lucy, who wants to win the prize more than anything.At its core, the novel is a simple, heartwarming story, one filled with lovable characters and fun riddles and games. There\u2019s some light romance to it, too, and it has loads of feel-good moments involving friendship and found family.But I wanted a touch more from it. Greater depth, richer characterization, and smoother dialogue, especially coming from the secondary characters. Some of the conversations in the story are rather stilted.And is it just me, or does Lucy\u2019s relationship with the child, Christopher, feel a bit odd? Their closeness and how they talked about Lucy being his mom seemed borderline inappropriate, especially in a school setting. I don\u2019t know \u2013 perhaps I need to adjust the way I see it.Still, a magical book, The Wishing Game. The nostalgia of it, the coziness of it. It\u2019s like a big bookish hug from your best friend.",

      "review_text": "Lovely book. A book lover's homage to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This was just a feel good story for me from start to finish. This is not a deep contemplative tale, it's a simple story of love, found family, and forgiveness. Jack Masterson is the beloved author of the Clock Island children's book series. He actually lives on Clock Island, right off the coast of Maine. Yet, for some reason, he has not written a book in six years. Lucy is a kindergarten aide with dreams to adopt seven-year-old Christopher. Unfortunately, a series of poor choices has left her deep in debt sharing an apartment with college students. When she was a child, due to her own family struggles, Lucy ran away to Clock Island and met Jack. News is released that he has written a new novel and has sent out invitations to four people to participate in a game in order to win rights to the book. Lucy receives one of these invitations and sets out on an adventure to claim what she wishes for most--the ability to have a family.I enjoyed getting to know Jack, Hugo (his illustrator), Lucy, Christopher, and the rest of the characters. They each have their own struggles and heartache, and the ending is a lovely testament to power of love and friendship. Implausible, yes, but don't we all need a good fairy tale ending sometimes? There are many nods to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and each one brought a smile of recognition to my face. There are games and riddles that the characters have to figure out and I totally enjoyed trying to figure them out myself. The book is whimsical, yes, but there is some depth here. Lucy had been through a lot, and I appreciated how she embraced growth and forgiveness when it was offered to her, even though she was fearful of being hurt again.If you enjoy books about books, filled with fun and adventure, look no further than this delightful debut. I look forward to seeing what she comes up with next.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",

For Lucy this dream is coming true just in time to give her a chance to adopt a boy and rescue him from foster care. This multi-layered new release is set on Clock Island. The author of the series holds a contest for four adults who have been super fans of his books. One thing I enjoyed was trying to solve the riddles in the challenges. That being said, I though author Jack Masterson was too manipulative. While I really loved Hugo Reese, the illustrator, and was rooting for Lucy to win the contest and adopt Christopher. Does she win? You will have to read the book and find out. \ud83d\ude09",

      "review_text": "In The Wishing Game, Lucy is living with three roommates on the meager salary of a teachers aide. She's estranged from her family but cares deeply about Christopher, a boy who's parents passed away when he was a student in her class. Together they share a love for a 60 volume kids book Lucy read as a kid.When the author announces he's written one more book, he invites four people to his island to compete for the book. Lucy gets to compete in hopes of making enough money off the book to adopt Christopher. I was rooting for Lucy and Christopher right away in chapter one, but quickly lost it. Lucy doesn't foster Christopher, so their time together is limited to seeing each other a little bit after school. Despite this, Lucy seems to have this strong desire to adopt Christopher and constantly calls herself his mother. Which I found really odd.Despite making very little money, not owning a car or a house, being only 26 years old, and living with three other roommates, Lucy thinks she's fit to adopt Christopher. Which...I just couldn't get behind. The social worker has to remind Lucy that he needs more than love, but someone who can drive him to the hospital if he gets sick, and a room of his own as opposed to sleeping on her floor with her roommates.Which are some solid points. Lucy still doesn't believe that she wouldn't be a good mom.Then we get to the competition, (more than halfway through the book) marketed as a Willy Wonka like adventure and contest on a mysterious island. Sounds promising? Well, they solve some riddles and play a game of monopoly. And that's pretty much it. It's not even a really detailed intense game of Monopoly, it's described and overwith in about a paragraph. (And no, it's not a game similar to Monopoly, it is literally the hasbro branded Monopoly board game). To say the least, a wonderful pitch with an execution that left me really disappointed.There were a few other things that didn't sit right with me, like our love line characters first meeting when he was 25 and she was 13. Or all of the small pointless subplots that cloud the story but don't have anything to add to it.Thank you Random house for sending me an ARC copy for an honest review",

I bought it because I loved the cover, and the title caught my attention. I didn't know about the nod to Willy Wonka afterward. Honestly, it didn't even cross my mind while reading it, but I can see it now that it was pointed out to me by other readers. I wouldn't say that this book has a fantasy vibe to it as much as a whimsical vibe. It has a realistic storyline that's more about what hope can do for one's life. Lucy and Christopher were great. It was great that this book touches on adoption. My husband was adopted as a baby, so I know how his life could've turned out without him being adopted by the most wonderful couple. Jack Masterson had me questioning his motives for a bit. We see that in The Wishing Game that people can be majorly flawed and still be great people. I was rooting for Lucy to win the game so she could adopt christopher. Lucy is a character that's likable, but Christopher will steal your heart.",

      "review_text": "I saw nothing but rave reviews of this which has me wondering if we're all reading the same book.The Wishing Game opens on Lucy, a 26 year old teaching assistant who lives with multiple roommates in a rundown apartment, telling a former student in her class who found his parents dead two years before that she's saving up to be his mom (he's in foster care currently). She's saddled with credit card debt and has no car but she's already told this kid she'll adopt him with her \"babysitting and knitting\" money. I mean, imagine thinking it's a good idea to promise something entirely out of your control to a child who has experienced trauma so early in their life. Lucy proceeds to have an entirely inappropriate relationship with this student, calling him at home, cuddling with him. There's even a scene where, unless I totally misunderstood, Lucy let's Christopher into her BED after his parents die. WHAT?Lucy feels so strongly about wanting to give a home to her student Christopher because she herself experienced loneliness and neglect as a child. She tells us this is because her parents didn't like her as much as her sister but pretty quickly we realize that maybe Lucy's parents didn't care more for her sister but rather that her sister had complex medical issues as a child that required the parents attention. No doubt Lucy could have suffered as a result of that situation and it's not surprising that child Lucy felt neglected and unloved but I find it pretty embarrassing that adult Lucy looks at that experience through the same lens. It's the height of self-centeredness to imagine that parents faced with a tough hand won't make any mistakes. Lucy similarly has no relationship with her sister because of this--her sister who was a sick child during these events but don't ask Lucy to consider that through an adult perspective. Lucy's determination to hold onto her parents caring for her sister as her martyr origin story is just too much. Perhaps Lucy should take her saved up 2k and invest in a therapist.I know every MC needs a \"why\" but every \"why\" in this book felt so contrived. About a quarter of the way through, I was fully dreading going along for the ride with Lucy as the voice in my head but I pushed forward. If you're on the fence at the point, you're probably better off DNFing this one--it does not improve once we find ourselves on Clock Island. The premise of this was intriguing but none of it landed. Lucy was insufferable. The story had so many silly or icky angles. This just missed all the marks for me.",

For any of us.The Wishing Game sounded like a nice cozy read for book lovers, but in reality it was not.I will admit that it had vibes similar to children's literature, with whimsiness and mystery, but the feeling of disappointment was louder than the coziness the book provided.Oh, even the frustration was bigger then the good feeling I hoped this book would provide.Call me a coldhearted bitch, but most of those heartwarming moments were getting on my nerves.I wasn't a fan of our MC, as I found her behaviour unprofessional. Even if we take that on a side, for some reason, I just couldn't root for her.Also, Jack creeped me out. Riddles were the best part of the book and it is little embarrassing to admit I didn't solve any of them (although I am sure some of my answers were also correct, like what flyes and doesn't have wings: \ud83c\udf88).Still, the last riddle (the one to chose the winner) was a HUGE disappointment. To all of us (book club members).The end was also dissatifaction as everything was served to our MC, in the most unbelievable way, and she didn't actually have to earn anything.I can understand why some people would like this book, but I can't understand how it was favorite read of 2023 to so many.I feel like it's overrated.",

If you also want to feel like that, then you should pick it up!This book is magical. If you're open to all things whimsical and wonderful with some real-world bits mixed in, this is the book for you.Years ago, famous and reclusive author Jack Masterson stopped writing his wildly popular children's books to the shock of the world. Suddenly, he resurfaces with a brand new book and a life-changing competition set on the remote island off the coast of Maine that he lives on. So far, this might sound like the premise of a thriller (lol) but let me assure you this is a heartwarming, life-affirming story. Lucy Hart is a huge fan of Jack Masterson's work and relied on his magical stories to get her through a rough childhood. Now, she's 26 and working as a teacher's aide. Her greatest dream is to adopt Christopher, a 7-year-old orphan who was once her student and now the child she tutors and spends all her free time with. Unfortunately, becoming a family seems impossible, given Lucy's financial situation. Lucy has exhausted every option available to make her dreams a reality. She is on the brink of giving up before she learns she's one of the 4 contestants chosen to participate in Jack's life-changing contest.This book is a love letter to storytelling. It's bursting with lovable characters, full of heartstring-pulling plots, sprinkled with hope, and finished off with a heap of magic. As an added bonus, I found myself googling a few words sprinkled throughout this book and, once learning their meaning, thinking to myself, \"I need to use that word in my everyday life.\" Stumbling across a new word felt like getting an Oreo-filled spoonful of cookies and cream ice cream.Simply put, I had the most marvelous time getting lost in this story. I will be pushing it into the hands of many of my friends.You come here for the beach reads, and this is simply that\u2014a book that makes you feel good. I would be shocked if this wasn't in my top 5 for the year.",

      "review_text": "I know, I know. Everyone loves Ann Patchett, just as everyone in this novel loves Joe and Sebastian and Lara and Ken and Maisie and the farm. Also Joe and Lara's three daughters, and the dog, and the grandmother. Also cherry pie. But a pile of comfy pillows only makes a nice place to read a good novel; it does not make an actual good novel.What happened to Ann Patchett's spice? To the rivalry and ambition and cunning and pain of her great novels like \"Commonwealth,\" \"The Dutch House,\" and\"The Magician's Assistant\"?In a word, this book is boring.Here's the plot, such as it is: As Covid spreads across the US in 2020, Joe and Lara are quarantining with their three grown daughters on the Michigan cherry farm that's been in Joe's family for generations. Without ordinary entertainment, this becomes a good time (supposedly) for Lara to tell the girls the story of her long-ago summer romance with Peter Duke, who later became a famous actor. That's the first problem: Since the daughters have spent their lifetimes repeatedly hearing that story and picking apart all the bits -- the eldest, Emily, is convinced that Duke is actually her father-- what's left for Lara to tell them? In order for this phony structure to work, someone has to constantly be saying: \"I can't believe I never asked you that before.\"But the worse problem is that everyone is soooo loving and understanding. Joe isn't jealous of the focus on Duke. Lara doesn't regret giving up the lights and glory of her own acting career or the potential of sharing Duke's. The sisters exhibit no sibling rivalry. No one argues or disagrees, except occasionally in cute and minor ways. The sole narrative tension is whether they'll get all the cherries harvested in time.True, there's a good plot twist a bit more than halfway through, plus a few more twists after that (several of them eminently foreseeable and one totally unbelievable). But that's a long time to ask the reader to maintain interest.I didn't.",

Although the writing is so divine, I might have to do both. The book is told from Lara\u2019s viewpoint. Thanks to Covid, all three of her daughters are back home on the family\u2019s cherry orchard. To help pass the days while picking cherries, they beg their mother to tell them of her romance with now famous actor Peter Duke. It\u2019s both light and deep at the same time. It\u2019s a look at the fun of summer stock theater, the innocence of young love, but also at what we chose to tell when we tell our stories (especially to family) and how well we can ever know our parents. Patchett just has a way with words. When describing the mania of young preteens, she likens it to giving them double chocolate cake with espresso. I had never read or seen Our Town. So, midway through this book, I quickly watched the 1940 movie. Spare yourself! And it\u2019s totally unnecessary to know that play to enjoy this book. What I especially loved is that Lara has no regrets about the choices she made. She loves her husband, her farm, her daughters. In fact, the joy is that she made the right choices. Ok, I know I\u2019m gushing, but this is such a wonderful ode to a real life, of recognizing both your strengths and weaknesses, of not necessarily reaching for the stars. And that ending! I know I would have loved this book regardless, but oh my God, Streep just took it up several notches.Update - so this is our January book club selection and I decided to read it this time. I loved it as much the second time around. And it definitely stands on its own, even without Meryl Streep.",

You might say it\u2019s her three daughters\u2019 stories who are home to help pick cherries on the family farm, since the workers can\u2019t come during the pandemic. It\u2019s not, though a story about the pandemic, for which I was thankful. It\u2019s a story of family, of relationships, a story of the past and present and perhaps where the future will take these young women . About the future, perhaps because Lara\u2019s story is really about realizing the only life she ever really wanted and that\u2019s the story she tells them. The daughters beg Lara to tell them about that summer and they hang on her every word telling of the actor and then how Lara later fell in love with their father, who by the way stole my heart . I also hung on her every word and every word that Patchett wrote. I very much appreciated that the reader becomes privy to a few parts of the story that she doesn\u2019t tell her daughters choosing to keep some things to herself and of course the reader . The writing is flawless , moving seamlessly back and forth between past and present even within chapters . To say that I was excited that Ann Patchett had a new novel is an understatement. To say that I was thrilled to be fortunate to get an advanced copy of it is a huge understatement. I fell in love with her writing from the first book of hers that I read, Bel Canto. Since then I\u2019ve read all of her novels and a book of her essays These Precious Days: Essays. She\u2019s a versatile writer and I\u2019m never disappointed no matter what the novel is about because she just has such a talent for creating relatable characters and relationships. This novel is just one more reason why I\u2019ll read anything she writes. I loved everything about it. I received a copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss.",

      "review_text": "Tom Lake by Ann Patchett is a Woman's Story Within a Family Story!This is Lara's story of a summer long ago spent in summer stock theater at Tom Lake where, in her early twenties, she fell in love with an extremely handsome fellow actor named Peter Duke. It's also the story of Lara's family, her husband Joe, their three daughters, Emily, Maisie, and Nell, and their life together on the farm and fruit orchard that's been in their family for generations.It's the Spring of 2020 with the Pandemic in full swing and all three adult daughters are home. It's cherry picking time which calls for all-hands-on-deck from this family since there's limited help due to the shutdown.Emily, Maisie, and Nell are fascinated and curious about their mother's past as an actress who shared the stage and a relationship with a famous movie star. They're begging to hear everything about it.Since they're all together in one spot and Lara is sufficiently worn down by her daughters pleas, they all continue to pick cherries in their orchard while Lara begins to tell them her story... Tom Lake is a story within a story. It's about choices and relationships, coming to terms with the choices you make, the relationships you build on, and the ones you don't. It's about planning for and living an intentional life.When I read The Dutch House I struggled to connect with this author's writing style. It felt dry, unemotional, and lacked the passion I anticipated. I had a similar experience with Tom Lake and although it was better at the midway point and at the end, it still ebbed and flowed for me. The last twenty-percent of this book completely held my attention and the ending fit the characters and the story like a glove. It's important for an author to end with something for the reader to chew on and Ann Patchett did exactly that. What I love about Tom Lake are the central characters. They are diverse, fully fleshed out, and interesting. I cared about and fell in love with all of them. I especially love Joe. Everyone needs someone like Joe in their life. This author certainly knows how to create wonderful characters, good ones and not so good ones. All aboard!I'm glad this author has such a strong following with many positive reviews and high ratings for this book. I like Tom Lake but I don't love it and I was expecting a better reading experience than I had. I do plan to listen to one of Patchett's previous books via audiobook to see if a different format will change how I feel about her writing overall. Maybe, maybe not, but I'm willing to try. 3.5\u2b50 Thank you to NetGalley, Harper, and Ann Patchett for an ARC of this book. It has been an honor to give my honest and voluntary review.",

      "review_text": "4.5\u2b50Set in Spring 2020 amid the COVID-19 lockdown, Tom Lake by Ann Patchett revolves around former actress Lara Kenison who lives and works with her husband in their family cherry orchard in Michigan. The pandemic has brought her whole family together as they shelter in place and help in the day-to-day operations of the orchard, making up for the shortfall in seasonal staff. Emily, the oldest of her three daughters, all of whom are in their twenties, is the only one who plans to take up running the farm in the future. Lara\u2019s youngest daughter, Nell, aspires to become an actress, and her middle daughter Maisie is studying to become a veterinarian.Her daughters press their mother for details of her short-lived romance with famous actor Peter Duke when she was in her twenties, while they were both part of the summer theater production of Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town in Tom Lake, Michigan. Peter wasn\u2019t a famous actor back then and though their romance was short-lived, Lara\u2019s experiences in Tom Lake played a significant role in the trajectory of her life. The narrative follows Lara as she shares significant episodes from her past, her brief career as an actress \u2013 her childhood and foray into acting in Community Theater and the years that followed. The narrative is shared from Lara\u2019s first-person perspective and we are privy to her innermost thoughts - her personal reflections on the important people, the significant events and the difficult choices that shaped her life- as she deliberates over what and how much to share with her family and the memories that she holds close to her heart. Their reactions to their mother\u2019s revelations range from awe to humor to indignation on her behalf, enabling them to see and understand their mother as the young women she once was, not too different from themselves. Lara\u2019s stories are spaced between present-day events, her family life on the family orchard with her husband and her interactions with her daughters wherein we get to know more about their dreams and aspirations, motivated to share significant memories and confidences inspired by their mother\u2019s stories. This is a character-driven, quiet and relatively slower-paced novel with well-thought-out characters. Ann Patchett\u2019s writing is beautiful and past and present timelines are woven seamlessly into a cohesive narrative that revolves around themes of family, love, ambition, choices, motherhood and mental health. The writing is sparse with minimal melodrama yet emotionally impactful with an ending that brings all the threads of the story together in the most satisfying way. I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful story.I won a copy of Tom Lake in a Goodreads Giveaway. Many thanks to the author and publisher for the gifted copy. All opinions expressed in this review are my own.Please note: The play Our Town is of great significance in both Lara\u2019s short-lived career as an actress and her life in general. Though it isn\u2019t necessary to have read Our Town by Thornton Wilder to enjoy Ann Patchett\u2019s Tom Lake, I feel having prior knowledge of the story would contribute to a rich reading experience and a greater appreciation of this novel.

The Sweet ones - not the tart.Three curious daughters longing to know of their mom\u2019s past involving a famously handsome actor. On a cherry orchard. During the summer. During Covid.Patchett\u2019s story telling is rich and reflective; layered with memories, sisters, family; the complexity of relationships and life decisions.

      "review_text": "What a lovely experience this was, listening to the incomparable Meryl Streep bring to life a book of Ann Patchett\u2019s. As much as I have my go-to narrators, Meryl Streep brought a whole new level of humanity, humor, and kindness to each character and to the story as a whole. I could just feel her nuanced, multi-faceted intelligence through her craft. If other narrators give 5-star readings, Meryl Streep is off the charts.I really enjoyed the story, too. In a way, it was a story about the power of story. A woman, her husband, and their three grown daughters are living together during the pandemic on a farm in Michigan. The family gathers around and listens to the mother tell stories of her past, when she fell into acting and dated a movie star before he was one. There is power in the simple act of sharing stories, and there was something idyllic about this close family gathered together for it on a cherry orchard.I loved the Meryl-Streep-embodied main character most of all, Lara, the mother, when she recounted what lead to acting in a summer stock theater nearby the farm. I knew what she meant when she said that a summer stock day was packed with the normal intensity of a week, and so on from there. It brought me back to times of sleep away camp when couples and best friends were determined by the first night. The heightened sense of being away from home, and thrown into newness and possibility, was well captured. It\u2019s no accident that colleges and universities by tradition house people of the same age together for a particular kind of learning and transition into adulthood. Patchett\u2019s summer stock brought me back.The reason Lara tells this story is because all of her grown daughters want to hear about the famous movie star she dated. It\u2019s a strong, believable reason, made more interesting by the sheer joy of youth and first love. As the story unfolds, it reveals the personalities and relationships between them in the here and now. It also deals with the fear that the world is ending. And while the mother is pretty straight with her daughters, she shares only with us what she\u2019s kept to herself, highlighting how stories are made by what she chose to tell, and revealing the paths not taken. Lara also admits her guilty pleasure of enjoying her daughters at home, despite it being because of the global pandemic. The knowledge that this is temporary makes it all the more precious\u2014just like summer stock. Just like a life. Maybe just like our world.4.5",

      "review_text": "Ann Patchett is so wise. About love, about family, and about pretty much everything life throws our way.I decided she was my new best friend after I listened to the audiobooks of her two essay collections, This is the Story of a Happy Marriage and These Precious Days, the latter of which is a true masterwork. Her intelligence, empathy for others, and logical way of looking at life drew me to her, and I have such admiration for who she is and all that she\u2019s accomplished.Now that my fangirling is out of the way, I\u2019ll move on to the book. Tom Lake, her latest \u2026 I loved it. But I didn\u2019t know if I would, seeing as it\u2019s a homage to Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town, a play I\u2019ve neither seen nor read. I should\u2019ve known, though, that all I adore about Patchett would shine through the story, allowing me to not be bothered by my unfamiliarity with the play.The novel consists of Lara telling her three grown daughters the story of the summer she starred in Our Town and dated the now-famous movie star, Peter Duke. Patchett switches between Lara\u2019s story of that summer with what is happening in the present day, where it\u2019s the spring of 2020, COVID has invaded the world, and all three daughters have returned to the family orchard in Northern Michigan to pick cherries.At first the story felt a bit too mundane. My attention wandered, and I worried that my foray into Patchett\u2019s fiction would be a disappointment. But the beauty of her prose never allowed me to set the novel aside, and before I knew it, I was so engrossed in Lara\u2019s tale that I forgot all else while I read it. It\u2019s just the kind of book it is \u2013 it sneaks up on you.There are surprising revelations throughout the story, along with warm meditations on marriage and children and love in all its shapes and sizes. And also present is a subtle urging to enjoy life in the moment and appreciate what is yours. Tom Lake gives so much to the reader, and because of the ease in which Patchett\u2019s words flow across the page, it asks for very little in return.My sincerest appreciation to Ann Patchett, Harper, and NetGalley for the digital review copy. All opinions included herein are my own.",

Of course the writing is solid\u2014I was interested in the cherry farm setting, and the relationship between the narrator and her grown daughters.But\u2026 I just did not buy the whole massive-movie-star-who-was-once-my-summer-boyfriend-thing. Peter Duke did not come across as a beautifully gifted, if somewhat troubled, actor\u2014he came across as a manipulative jerk. There was nothing attractive about him. I also grew tired of all the \u201cOur Town\u201d references (unpopular opinion but that play is so irritating) and the Covid timeframe. I\u2019m not ready to read novels set during Covid, especially ones that romanticize the experience as a time to make potato salad and to hand sew face masks. Get serious. But maybe that\u2019s just me\u2026",

For me this was boring, as in, put the book down and want to scream boring; as in grit my teeth because it\u2019s still not finished boring. There was no edge, no humor, no slant. None of the characters were developed into believable, living people. The daughters were distinguable only by their chosen vocations. The main character is someone I would feign illness to avoid at an office party for lack of personality. What is Joe like? I have not the faintest clue. And Duke? Just his vices and his teeth. And our Sebastian? Wtf? Please. I know nothing about these characters after slogging through the book for hundreds of pages. The novel consists of the main character relaying a brief acting career and romance from her pre-married life to her daughters who are riveted for reasons I don\u2019t understand. Who are these docile creatures? Why are they so lacking in fight, independence, mischief and rebellion at their age? Instead they wait with baited breath day after day for the least interesting pre-married life romance I\u2019ve ever heard. The story telling within the novel is interrupted periodically by cherry picking and yes, I felt like I was there in the orchard plotlessly looking at cherries. I assumed something interesting would be revealed from her past life. Boy was I disappointed.",

      "review_text": "I'm not sure how Ann Patchett keeps getting better and better with each book, but she does. I have loved them all, some more than others, but this is my favorite, probably until the next one.A master at her craft, the top of her game, a writer's writer, literary superstar....take your pick of cliches, they're all true, at least for me.Tom Lake is a place, not a person, as I thought before reading it. It's a beautiful tribute to Thornton Wilder's Our Town. Lara played Emily Webb, the female lead, in high school, then went on years later to play her in summer stock theater in Tom Lake, Michigan. She falls in love with another actor, who goes on to become a famous movie star. She later marries the owner of a cherry farm in Michigan and raises a family. During the Covid shutdown, her three adult daughters come home to spend the summer helping in the cherry orchard, and beg for the story of her relationship to the actor. Which they get, in bits and pieces, but not all of it; no mother is going to tell her daughters everything.Our Town infuses the whole plot, wrapped around the Tom Lake action, but the present day scenes as well. Lara wouldn't be where she is without Our Town, her life would be poorer had it never happened. This novel takes place in different timelines, so expertly done that we readers are always there, never really knowing how it's going to pan out, but knowing that it will. Surprises all along the way, pleasant ones mostly, leading to an ending that couldn't be more perfect. Patchett gives us the same wisdom as Wilder did. Things happen, life goes on, we all do the best we can in our own little corners of the world.I read Our Town in high school, later saw a stage production of it, and yesterday watched the 1940 film version. The sound and picture quality is awful, but the acting is pretty good. I'm betting that sales of the play are going to skyrocket after this book, and local and national theater groups will decide to bring it back. Tom Lake is a great book even if you aren't familiar with the play, but the play itself is pretty spectacular. Read them both, just for the sheer entertainment value.",

It\u2019s not a love story in the conventional sense, but it is a love story between a woman and her daughters, her life, her husband, and her past. I feel like saying a book is slow has such negative connotations, but I really mean it in the best way possible. This book is to be savored and read slowly. Sometimes, when reading, in my excitement, my eyes can\u2019t help but hop around. This book forced me to be present and alert. Much better paired with a cup of coffee than a cocktail (although I am pairing it with a cocktail!).Our book is set in the spring of 2020. We meet Lara, who owns a cherry farm in Northern Michigan with her husband. Due to COVID, her 3 adult daughters have returned home to help with the harvesting. As a way to pass the time and due to the relentless curiosity of her daughters, Lara is sharing the story of her first love, who now happens to be one of the most famous actors in the world. While this is set at the peak of the pandemic, COVID is merely a footnote, and I didn\u2019t find it terribly distracting.This story has the intimacy of a kitchen table shared with your mom and aunts. Sharing stories over glasses of wine and getting a peak into their past. It\u2019s brimming with love and contains so much honesty when it comes to mother-daughter relationships. It made me want to call my mom and yearn for a daughter one day. I thought it was just such an excellent portrayal of family and love.I love the tone of this story. I only hope that in 30 years, I find myself at peace with myself and my decisions as Lara is.Audiobook fans - the audiobook is narrated by Meryl Streep! What a treat!",

      "review_text": "It is a relief to pick up an Ann Patchett novel, even one that is Just Fine, like this one. I don't know how her books are so utterly absorbing, but they are. There is not a lot to this book, though that doesn't mean it's short on pleasure. A woman recounts an old love affair to her adult daughters as they pick cherries on their family farm. It isn't as leisurely as it sounds, it is the summer of 2020, most of the usual workers aren't there, but the cherries still must be picked and life must go on. Most of the substance of the book is the story Lara tells us, which is as much a story about her time as an actress as it is about this love affair. Lara has the kind of unlikely fairy tale of a story that doesn't really happen anymore, much to the chagrin of her daughter who actually wants to be an actress, and she stumbles into almost everything that happens to her. Somehow she has never really told her daughters the whole story, and now as her daughters are around the age she was it and they have nothing but time it finally seems like the right time to tell it. This is technically a pandemic novel and yet it hardly is one. This ties into my major complaint with the book, in that it feels strangely sanitized. In the current events part of the plot, everyone is good. Lara loves her husband Joe, who never does anything that is not perfect and kind. She has a good relationship with her three daughters, who may have their own complicated feelings about being at home and pausing their own lives, but Lara is delighted, so glad they are there that she almost entirely overlooks those difficulties. It is not that people like Lara aren't realistic, at one point she is baffled that her daughters question the point of having children because of climate change and yup there are a lot of people like Lara who find this baffling. But Lara's happiness is rather dull. She does not seem all that concerned about the global pandemic or all the people dying. She is that mom who is just happy her kids are home. It's strange to read that presented as the narrative point of view without any interrogation.It is an easy book to read, a light one, too. Bad things happen, but the worst of it is already over. And really, the book seems to say, if you just stay with your family on a cherry farm everything will just be fine forever. Sometimes that is the book you want, and that is what Patchett has given us. It's a bit strange, since her family dynamics have usually been so complex, but perhaps she just wanted a nice, small something.",

      "review_text": "I don't fall in love with many books but this one is too beautiful not to.So my advice would be that if you haven't already seen Our Town then you either read the play or watch the movie (even though they changed the end of the 1940 version) because this book is an homage to that play.The story of Lara Kinnison, Joe Nelson and Peter Duke is a mirror of Our Town by Thornton Wilder. Lara is a small town girl who plays Emily from Our Town in a community theatre production. Some producer sees her and whisks her away to Hollywood but events conspire and Lara finds herself back in Michigan at Tom Lake playing summer stock as Emily opposite the charismatic Peter Duke. This novel is steeped in the same spell that Our Town casts. It follows Lara into the next generation where, years later, she is a wife and mother -- her grown daughters home during lockdown to help bring in the cherry harvest on the family farm. As they work Lara recounts her life as an actress, her love affair with Duke and how she ended up with the real hero of the story, their father.This is my first Ann Patchett, it won't be my last. I found the rhythm of her prose hypnotic. I found myself speaking the dialogue with the same slow drawl as used in Our Town. It is primarily a book about family and continuity, about ambitions and real dreams, about love and acceptance and understanding. It is about knowing who you really are and what you really want from life. I honestly loved this book and I certainly didn't expect to. Highly recommended. Thankyou to Netgalley and Bloomsbury Publishing for the advanced review copy.",

      "review_text": "Well this book took me way longer to read than expected\u2026 This was another book that I had high hopes for as I loved Patchett\u2019s \u201cThe Dutch House\u201d. This book is also set in northern Michigan, and I am a true Michigander- I\u2019ve lived in Michigan all my life, so I really thought that I would love this book even more. One of the characters even attended college at Michigan State, where my son is currently a freshman- so I thought I would really resonate with this book. Unfortunately, this book fell very flat for me. I almost gave up on \u201cTom Lake\u201d several times. However, the last 100 pages or so redeemed themselves and I stuck with it.This story takes place in the Spring of 2020 during the pandemic. Lara\u2019s three daughters have come back home to the family farm/cherry orchard. During this time Lara begins to tell her daughters about the time she spent a summer with a famous actor named Peter Duke, at a theater called Tom Lake. During this summer Lara was only 24 years old, never married and her daughters had not yet been born. During this summer between Lara and Peter Duke, they were in a play called Our Town and Lara played Emily. Lara and Duke were a hot item, and then a sudden turn of events happened and they went their separate ways. Lara decided not to continue with acting, but Duke rose to stardom. Lara\u2019s three daughters are infatuated with Peter Duke, especially her oldest daughter Emily. So yeah\u2026 this was a decent enough story, but I think that I was expecting so much more. I mean I think we could all write a book about some of our crazy, wild love affairs that we had when we were younger (and some would be way more entertaining than this story). If I\u2019m being honest, this book was a bit of a snooze fest \ud83d\ude34- not my favorite by Patchett. Although, I will be watching for her next book! This was a Reese Witherspoon book club pick for August, 2023. With that being said, I can see why there are so many high ratings\u2026 (2.5 stars, rounded up)",

      "review_text": "We are experiencing the spring of 2020, the start of the Covid-19 lockdown with Lara, now 57. She is sheltering in place with her husband, Joe Nelson, and their 3 20-something daughters, Emily, Maisie and Nell. With harvesters scarce, this opens the time up for Lara to tell her story about her brief career as an actor. The highlight of her life as Emily Gibbs, the tragic heroine in \u201cOur Town.\u201d The story is told in flashbacks. And\u2026It showcases Lara playing Emily in both high school and college in New Hampshire, with a brief detour to Hollywood, and then\u2026Summer stock at a theater company, the titular Tom Lake (hence: the title of the book), that happened to be near-ish the orchard. At Tom Lake, Lara, who plays the character Emily, has eyes only for 28-year-old Peter Duke, another actor who played the father in the play. He actually goes on to become a huge celebrity, a serious actor who eventually wins an Oscar, but also descends into addiction. But\u2026 While at Tom Lake, Duke and Lara spend all their time together, rehearsing, having sex, or swimming in the lake. Still\u2026When the summer ends, so does everything else.As mentioned, Duke is off to his successful Hollywood career.Lara on the other hand quits acting, marries her cherry farmer, Joe, and becomes a mother.Lara\u2019s Emily grows convinced that Duke, was her actual father \u2013 so much so, that even readers are left in genuine suspense about whether it is possibly true, as well. But\u2026The larger theme is that it may not matter\u2026Children inherit the full range of our experience, as much as genetic traits.This novel is folksy, cozy, domestic contentment. When Nell laments the celebrity Lara could perhaps have been, she exclaims\u2026\u201cLook at this! Look at the three of you! You think my life would have been better spent making commercials for lobster rolls?\u201dEach daughter is given their own personality. Emily \u2013 fiery; Maisie - sensible; and Nell - intuitive. Against the backdrop of the pandemic, and their mother\u2019s backstory, this book becomes a wistful meditation \u2013 a story of mothers and daughters. An opportunity for closure for Lara. Maybe\u2026 Even an awakening of what is important to Lara \u2013 of what she is lucky to have \u2013 what any of us are lucky to have, in these circumstances. Is this a peaceful existence? Is Lara really happy? Or\u2026Did she find a contentment, because that is what one settles for in life?I understand that the audio version has Meryl Streep as the voice narrating. That must have been a real treat for readers of this book.",

      "review_text": "Set in the early summer of 2020, Ann Patchett's ninth novel once again tackles the messy nature of family life and how our hold of the past can shape or mar our present experience, depending on our point of view.Lara is a mother of a three and married to a cherry farmer in Michigan. She spends a week or two recounting the summer she spent performing in a production of Thornton Wilder's Our Town and falling in love with Peter Duke, who would go on to become a famous movie star, at the eponymous Tom Lake.Patchett expertly weaves together the past and present, having the daughters interject and question their mother, and then pulling as back into Lara's recollections.The prose is cozy, warm and rose-colored. But Patchett doesn't sit in that space for too long, letting Lara give the reader's more information than she does her daughters. It's in the telling that the story is shaped and asks: can we be happy with a life when we know there is another one we might have lived?I laughed out loud many times during this story, and also got chills from its sobriety. We all can remember how it felt in the early days of the pandemic, how fragile life seemed, like a wispy cherry blossom falling from a gnarled branch. And yet there isn't despair in this story. Like in Our Town, life ends in a cemetery, and so too does this story; but not, perhaps, how you think.I perhaps struggled a bit with the ending, as I do sometimes with life and its cliches. But they are cliches for a reason, and while it could have felt avoidable, I choose to believe Patchett, in her many years of living, loving and writing, chose to end things as she did simply because some things in life are unavoidable. It's simply what you choose to pay attention to that ends up feeling, at times, inevitable.",

      "review_text": "Appreciating the little things in life, the joy of day-to-day existence, and the love for your family and your work is what Tom Lake meant to me. Tom Lake refers to a (fictional) summer stock theater in northern Michigan in the 1980s, close to the locale of the current 2020 timeline--- a cherry farm (and pears, and apples). The late eighties marked a luminous period for protagonist/narrator Lara, a time that she walked the fine line between adulting and adulthood, coming of age amid a torrent of drama that swept her up in its fury. And then there was Our Town,  the play within the novel that portrayed Lara\u2019s life on the stage (and backstage).Lara is telling her three twenty-something daughters about her short stint as an actress in her twenties, and the brief romantic affair with Peter Duke, a famous movie star before he was a famous movie star. (And then there are the parts she keeps to herself.) The gorgeous cherry farm backdrop is like a staid but vivid character, with Lara, husband Joe, and the three girls all together for the first time in a while. Due to the pandemic, they don\u2019t have the usual crew to help pick the fruit, so the storytelling unfolds as the family works the orchard during harvest time. Like the cherries, some parts are sweet, some tart, and all of it is juicy.I felt the air, inhaled the scents, the cherries, the land and the whole layout of the farm while reading. And there is the kindness, too, of this family, whose flaws are also part of their strengths. The chaos of Lara\u2019s life as a young woman is juxtaposed with the serenity of her life now, and the two timelines fluidly alternate, sometimes gently, at other times with piercing intensity. And every storyline has at least two. So, when you read about Lara in the past, or present, you just can\u2019t help sniffing around to see the connections, of what surprise is crouched in the corner or hidden behind the door. I verily slipped into Lara\u2019s character and imagined what decisions I would make as her, given so many pressing options and dilemmas. Ann Patchett nails it every time, her characters are complex and her graceful pace is measured even when events are brutal. Lara is a radiant work-in-progress during her young years, many readers will see themselves in her. I was a local stage actor in Austin during my twenties, so I immersed myself in Tom Lake, pretending to be Lara acting as Emily Gibbs and then back to Lara again. The two timelines showed the difference between the fiery summer love of youth and the deep, tender, and mature love of family that you helped to create. The high points were explosive, even when they were pin-drop quiet. Lara\u2019s low points stirred me almost to tears; I could feel her pulse against mine.If you\u2019ve never seen a production or haven\u2019t read Our Town,  you\u2019re about to get a spoiler\u2019s worth in the novel. But I think Ms. Patchett has surmised that most of her readers are already familiar with Thornton Wilder\u2019s play. She coalesced Our Town and Tom Lake together in a way that reveals her refined skill of integration. Tom Lake and Our Town were separate but conjoined. I know that doesn\u2019t make sense, but it will when you read the book. She also quotes Chekhov at pique (and even peak) intervals; she shares the Russian writer\u2019s work with spare but specific devotion. I recently learned that Patchett has never owned a smart phone, and doesn\u2019t herself do social media (she talks to the camera and her staff completes the rest). She has never used Google, or researched on Wiki\u2014she does it the old-fashioned way. And perhaps she\u2019s that slightly eccentric but lovely gentlewoman you see carrying paper road maps! She gives me hope. Tom Lake is thoughtful, deft, and life-affirming. (It isn\u2019t a pandemic novel, even though it takes place during that time). There\u2019s comedy, tragedy, drama\u2014a look-back-at-your- own-life kind of book. It\u2019s classic Ann Patchett. There\u2019s this passage that really tickled me from the book. It\u2019s toward the end but not a spoiler, it\u2019s thematic with the rest of the narrative. Lara was so busy recounting the past for her daughters that she forgot to make lunch, which she said she should have been working on while talking. \u201cThe past need not be so all-encompassing that it renders us incapable of making egg salad.\u201d Priorities!Oh, and the swimming!!! Patchett captured swimming and the near-spirituality of swimming with her clear and refreshing prose. Not splashy--only the water is.",

It felt as though the main character was in some version of the same play maybe half-a-dozen times (though it was probably three or four), as well as acting in a film, commercials, and a sitcom. We learn nothing about her time on the sitcom or filming the commercials and precious little about her time on the film. Her years in the theater were largely spent on cigarettes, alcohol, and a boyfriend who went on to become famous. He smoked and drank, and became famous that's all I learned about him, other than his name. Like most of the novel's characters, he lacked distinguishing traits and was incredibly dull. However, the main character's three daughters are fascinated with him and want to keep hearing more about him because for some reason they haven't already heard a ton about this famous, super-boring guy their mom used to date. Whyyyyy... didn't I stop reading sooner?",

      "review_text": "I wish I could give \u2018The Five-Star Weekend\u2019, a five-star review\u2026 Although the premise was exciting, I think I\u2019ve just unfortunately read too many Elin Hilderbrand novels. At this point, every book just seems the same - same story, different cast. This book centers around Hollis Shaw. Hollis is recently widowed and grieving. So Hollis decides to have a five-star weekend at her summer home in Nantucket. For this weekend, Hollis invites four friends from all different stages in her life (which I actually love this idea). We have Tatum- her childhood best friend. Dru-Ann, her best friend from college. Brooke- her friend from when their children were growing up together. And Gigi- who was her favorite internet friend (Gigi follows Hollis\u2019s blog). All these women have problems of their own, even though they put on a happy face to the rest of the world. There\u2019s also some \u201cfriendship rivalry\u201d going on, as some of them think they should be Hollis\u2019s best friend. Hollis has her daughter Caroline, interview and film each of the women and tell their stories of how they all know Hollis. The five-star weekend ends up being so much more than what each woman thought it would be. So yes, there were some pretty good parts in this book. But, I found myself getting bored quite often as well. Once again, as with the past few books of Hilderbrand, I found that her books are nothing more than a walking (in this case writing) advertisement for Nantucket Island. Hilderbrand writes about all the hot spots to go to, which stores to shop at for all the latest fashion designers, and also which independent bookstore to shop at to purchase your books (I mean, there is no harm in being loyal). Hilderbrand also puts too much emphasis on what each character is wearing, and what designer handbag they\u2019re carrying. We also have to hear about what each character ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!! If this was my first Hilderbrand novel that I read, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but at this point it\u2019s just too redundant. Hilderbrand is always good for a nice summer, beach read \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f However, for me personally I think it\u2019s time to move on. I want a good story, less advertisements. I have heard that Hilderbrand is retiring from writing novels next year, in 2024. I will be sad to see her quit writing, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she comes out with a cookbook or two. She goes into great detail with her food descriptions in this book and some of her previous ones. That\u2019s just my opinion\u2026",

      "review_text": "Let's face it\u2014it isn't a proper summer without the quintessential beach read. And Elin Hilderbrand's books have become a go-to for me in recent years. But unfortunately, The Five-Star Weekend didn't quite end up scratching that summertime itch.Hollis is grieving for her dead husband. She gets the idea to host a weekend get-together for her best friends, inviting one from each phase of her life, in the hopes that being surrounded by friends will help her heal and move on. But each of these women is battling her own issues and the weekend doesn't really turn out the way Hollis expects.Elin Hilderbrand's books always feel light and fun, and this one's no different. It's the sort of story I pick up when I need a distraction. It's easy to get sucked into the island of Nantucket, with all of its water, sunshine, and delicious food. But at the end of the day, something about this story just didn't click for me.Maybe it's because this feels more like a disjointed collection of stories about the different women rather than a cohesive whole. They're each having their own issues, and for the most part, they don't overlap. Hilderbrand could very well have written separate stories for each of them, and it would've still made sense.Or maybe I just don't buy into the premise. I can't imagine a former friend dropping everything to fly out and spend a weekend with me and a few others they don't know, just to comfort me. But perhaps that's me being cynical and this sort of thing really does happen.Or maybe it's because while the women's issues are real, the resolutions somehow end up feeling a bit shallow. Everything is wrapped up too neatly by the end of the book, whether the issue was medical, spousal, or work. Like the proverbial happily ever after, everyone gets one, even if the circumstances are too convenient or magical to be believable.Whatever the reason, this story just didn't quite rise to the level of beachy magic I usually associate with Elin Hilderbrand. Don't get me wrong, I still had fun with it. But I always hope for a memorable reading experience, and this one was all too forgettable.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Perfect CoupleThe Hotel NantucketSummer of '69Winter in Paradise~~~~~~~~~~~~\u2727 Connect with me \u2727 Instagram \u2727This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

      "review_text": "What truly sets this book apart is the way Hilderbrand skillfully crafts the relationships between the characters. Each member of the group possesses their own unique personality, quirks, and secrets, which made them feel like real people with relatable joys and struggles. The link to the audiobook can be found here \nThe Five-Star Weekend\n. I found myself emotionally invested in their individual journeys, rooting for their growth, and eagerly turning the pages to uncover the layers of their stories.Hilderbrand's ability to capture the essence of friendship is unparalleled. The bond between the characters felt genuine and deep, filled with shared memories, inside jokes, and unwavering support. As the weekend unfolds, their connections deepen, and I felt like an honorary member of their close-knit circle, cherishing the moments of laughter, tears, and heartfelt conversations.The pacing of the novel was perfectly balanced, effortlessly blending moments of levity and introspection. Hilderbrand's writing style is engaging and immersive, making it easy to lose myself in the story and lose track of time. The effortless flow of the narrative kept me engaged, eager to witness the twists and turns that awaited the characters.\"The Five-Star Weekend\" is more than just an escape into a luxurious setting. It is a story that explores themes of self-discovery, forgiveness, and the transformative power of friendship. Through Hilderbrand's skillful storytelling, I was reminded of the importance of cherishing our relationships, embracing life's unexpected turns, and finding joy in the simple moments.If you're in need of a blissful and heartwarming read that will transport you to the enchanting world of Nantucket, \"The Five-Star Weekend\" is the perfect choice. Elin Hilderbrand's enchanting storytelling, relatable characters, and the beauty of their interconnected lives will leave you yearning for your own unforgettable weekend of sun, sand, and meaningful connections.",

      "review_text": "I have been an absolutely adoring fan of Hilderbrand for years. I think I've read all of her books except for maybe two or three of her books from the very beginning. They even made me book a trip to Nantucket to indulge in the summers she so beautifully describes. However, all good things must come to an end. Hearing this was her last one, I was expecting a finale of epic proportions. Unfortunately, I was wrong. But like the old saying goes, I truly think this \"isn't you--it's me.\" I grew so exhausted of the name-dropping, the fascination/obsession with being skinny (I can't count the times one main character questioned her eating/ bemoaned her non-flat stomach). Maybe I'm reading these books with a different lens: it felt classist. There was even some mention of being \"classist\" when one of our main characters, the one main character who doesn't work a million-dollar job, feels like she is in a different class than all the rest (because she is.) This is definitely someone's cup of tea. I just think maybe I've grown tired of the same story (of course, one that involves cheating). I'd had my breakups with authors before. I'm not saying this is forever, but I am saying that if there are more Hilderbrand novels, I don't think I'll be rushing to read them like I have in the past. This one just missed the spark her other novels had. I can't totally put my finger on it.",

Hollis, a famous food blogger (think Ina Garten famous), living on Nantucket, is a new widow, having lost her husband in a car accident. She has a strained relationship with her daughter, and is at loose ends as to how to move forward. She decides to host a \u201cFive-Star Weekend\u201d with her guests being her best friend from different stages of her life. The weekend doesn\u2019t quite go as planned, as each of the women have issues of their own. The setting and the descriptions of the food was enough to carry the story, and the backstories of the friends was enough to give the novel substance, while keeping it light and breezy.

The Five-Star Weekend is her twenty-ninth novel, and every year Elin Hilderbrand proceeds to craft a book that is light, airy, fresh, easy to read, quick, full of wit and sharp humor, and just makes me so damn happy to read\u2026..while at the same, being so layered and full of fully fleshed out characters with so many relatable issues in their lives. Her books get placed in a box and often written off as simply being a beach book; but they just do something to me every year when I read them, and for the last 5-6 years I\u2019ve been lucky to enough to get them as ARCs, so my Februarys are always the time of year I look forward to most, when the typical reader has to wait til June for their summer to begin with Elin\u2026.my summer always starts early! And this year\u2019s novel was no exception, what she has crafted in The Five-Star Weekend is a deeply intimate portrait of grief, resilience, and the bonds of female sisterhood; all sprinkled with fun, food, music, and ofcourse, some time at The Chicken Box ;) (If you haven\u2019t been to Nantucket or read an Elin Hilderbrand book, I\u2019m sorry that you don\u2019t get that final reference \ud83d\ude05)",

      "review_text": "I have read several of Elin Hilderbrand\u2019s books over the years. A few things that I have come to rely upon when I read one of Elin\u2019s books is that they will transport me to a place that entertains, provides me with some drama and intersperses me among characters that I can escape with. I love that her books are set in picturesque Nantucket. The Five-Star Weekend was no exception. As soon as I began reading The Five-Star Weekend, I was whisked into Hollis Shaw\u2019s life. I found myself transported into her everyday life. That included her interactions with her devoted followers from her food blog, Hungry with Hollis, the drama in her life that included her turbulent marriage with husband, Matthew, a prominent and respected heart surgeon who had been at her side for so many years, her relationship with her impressionable young adult daughter, Caroline and just her life in general.Hollis\u2019s and Matthew\u2019s marriage had been in a rut for some time. They seemed to be more like roommates than husband and wife. Somehow the magic had disappeared from their marriage and their relationship. Matthew was traveling a great deal and even when he was home Hollis and Matthew seemed to avoid each other. It was winter around holiday time and Hollis was planning their annual holiday party. Matthew informed Hollis that he would not be back in time for the party. He was traveling again. Harsh words were exchanged by both Hollis and Matthew before he closed the front door and headed to his car. Matthew\u2019s last words to Hollis were, \u201cYou\u2019ve changed. We\u2019ve changed.\u201d Hollis was still repeating that sentiment when the bell at the front door rang. She was positive that Matthew had returned to say he was sorry and that he would make sure he was home for their party but standing in front of Hollis were two policemen. Hollis was about to receive the worst news of her life. The policemen informed Hollis that Matthew had been in a fatal car accident. His car had hit a mother deer and her baby. Matthew had died instantly. Hollis became a widow that fateful day. She was so distraught that their last words they spoke to one another were in anger.When Hollis informed her followers of Hungry with Hollis that she would be stepping back for an extended period of time so she could mourn her husband\u2019s death, one of her followers told her about how she hosted something called a \u201cfive-star weekend\u201d and how it had helped her come to terms with her grief and how to proceed with the rest of her life. Hollis decided that that was what she would do. She would host a \u201cfive-star weekend \u201c in Nantucket at her home. Hollis would include a friend from every stage of her life. Tatum would represent her childhood friend, Dru-Ann, her college roommate would represent her college years, Brooke would represent the friend during the years she raised her daughter and lived in Wellesley and Gigi would represent her newest friend from her blog who had been there for Hollis when she needed someone to talk to. Hollis also decided to invite her daughter, Caroline, to film the weekend. Her ultimate goal for the \u201cfive star weekend\u201d was for it to help Hollis through her grief of loosing Matthew. What better way than to be surrounded by your oldest, most devoted, and cherished friends! Needless to say, Hollis\u2019s carefully planned weekend did not go exactly as planned. What would transpire? Be prepared for surprises and unexpected secrets.The Five-Star Weekend by Elin Hilderbrand was delightful and entertaining from start to finish. I enjoyed the relationships Hollis and her friends had forged. All the characters made me feel like I was included in their special weekend with Hollis. I loved all the yummy food that was mentioned throughout the book. The Five-Star Weekend could be your next beach read or just a moving yet fun book for now. I highly recommend this book.Thank you to Little, Brown and Company for allowing me to read The Five-Star Weekend by Elin Hilderbrand through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

      "review_text": "Happy Publication Day to Elin Hilderbrand on her 29th novel!! Grab the bathing suit, the towel, the sunscreen, and the wide-brimmed hat!  The Five-Star Weekend is without a doubt going to be an essential accessory in your beach bag this season.  When Hollis Shaw finds herself a recent widow after the death of her husband, she and her adult daughter, Caroline find their relationship quite strained. Once an active social media influencer, Hollis feels more than a little lost. When a fan on her blog suggests getting a group of friends together from different points of her life, Hollis decides it's the remedy she has been seeking. Hollis invites her childhood friend, Tatum, her college roommate DruAnn, her friend from the child-rearing years, Brooke, and a fan from her blog that she has never met but feels connected to, Gigi. Add in an invite to entice daughter, Caroline to film their holiday weekend on Nantucket and it's bound to be exciting. But Hollis isn't the only attendee of this weekend that is struggling... All of the above share the narration and I enjoyed having each woman's back story and voice in this novel. It's one of the reasons I continue to return to Elin Hilderbrand's writing. Did I sometimes want to shake them for some of their decisions? Yes! But I read this story in one sitting because each character was so compelling.  I have read enough EH to realize that some of the plot was going in a direction that was pretty clear BUT it wasn't even a quibble I had about the story. That's because this novel just had the Elin Hilderbrand magic. I don't know what we're all going to do when this woman takes her retirement. Who will keep us visiting Nantucket every summer? Thanks to NetGalley and Little, Brown, and Company for access to this title. I am auto-approved for this publisher.

Elin Hilderbrand is the undisputed queen of the beach read, and somehow, 29 books later, she can still write a fresh & captivating story.In picking up this book, you are once again transported to the gorgeous island of Nantucket. Like all Elin books, this is chock full of the best kind of indulgences. Mouth-watering food, luxurious linens, frosty bottles of Sancerre, grand sailboats cutting through clear water. No book transports me quite as much as an Elin book.Our story is about Hollis Shaw, wife, mother, and creator of the wildly popular food blog, Hungry With Hollis. When Hollis' husband dies suddenly in a car crash, life as she knows it comes to a screeching halt. As she prepares for her yearly pilgrimage to the island of Nantucket and grapples with how difficult this summer will be, she learns about another widow that hosted something called a Five Star Weekend: a weekend filled with a friend from each chapter of her life. Hollis is inspired to round up a friend from high school, college, and early motherhood; her friend for this chapter of life is unique in that Hollis has never met her! She's a Hungry with Hollis fan who has helped Hollis through some of her darkest days following the death of her husband. Each woman comes with their own literal and metaphorical baggage as they navigate this unique girls' weekend that will leave them forever changed.Elin has a knack for writing life-affirming novels that are happy and hopeful. Elin's books always leave me filled with joie de vivre.I splurged on a bottle of Casa Dragones, which graces the page of many Elin novels, which I'm using to make the watermelon margarita recipe (swipe for the recipe!).I've decided to rank my top 3 Elin books for fun- please let me know yours!1. 28 Summers (check out the playlist inspired by this book in my stories!)2.

And then there\u2019s Gigi, a stranger to everyone (including Hollis) who reached out to Hollis through her blog. Gigi embodies an unusual grace and, as it happens, has many secrets.The Five-Star Weekend is a surprising and captivating story about friendship, love, and self-discovery set on Nantucket. It will be a weekend like no other.I have no way to improve upon that other than saying I truly enjoyed this book and love the idea of a five star weekend with my closest friends only we\u2019d be a four star weekend. I think I need a fifth. Friend! Not a fifth of booze but hey it\u2019s after 5pm \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0f!",

      "review_text": "First of all, I was dying to read a novel by THE Elin Hilderbrand. I was so excited to grab a copy of this book and what can I say? I am not surprised that Hilderbrand is a bestselling author! This novel is a feel-good, heartwarming, engaging, absolutely absorbing story. It made me want to be there!Find me on instagramThe story of an eventful weekend is set in Nantucket. I loved the landscape, the breeze of the sea \ud83c\udf0a, the restaurants and pretty much everything about this place. Hilderbrand is describing all locations with so much genuineness as she is a local from Nantucket. I understand that all her novels are set there. Holly as the main female protagonist is a social media phenomenon with her cooking skills. Upon the deadly accident of her husband, Holly initiates a five-star-weekend at her luxurious house in Nantucket. Five stars refer to five women in their 50\u2019s who have endured the ups and downs in their lives and marriages. Above all, every singe woman is associated with a specific time phase Holly\u2019s life stages. Tatum is her childhood friend, Dru Ann her college friend, Brooke her mom friend and then there is Gigi, whom she befriended on the internet. Get ready for a weekend with lots of flashbacks, grudges held over years, creation of new memories and lots of fun. I absolutely loved this novel and will read more of EH\u2019s books. Easy five stars!",

The characters felt like caricatures (no one more so than Gigi, whose language made me think the author had never met an English person and was basing it all on Bridgerton style dialogue...). The plot seemed to drag as well, and I found my attention drifting more than once. I picked it up, because I thought it would offer fun escapism in a beutiful setting, but I just never really connected with the story. That being said, I am probably just the wrong audience here, as so many readers love it, and that's the beauty of books.",

      "review_text": "Elin is back with another winner and must read for this summer!!When tragedy strikes, newly widowed Hollis Shaw decides to recreate her own \u201cFive Star Weekend\u201d and invite four friends, from four different stages of her life, to spend an unforgettable weekend with her in Nantucket. Filled with love, friendship, mother-daughter tension, drama, and secrets, you will be flipping through the pages to find out how the weekend plays out. What I loved:-Hollis was such a fun main character that you want nothing but to root for. I love how she had a big social media presence with her food blog, the opportunity for a second chance at love with her HS boyfriend and how she rekindled some older friendships at a time when she needed these people the most. -Elin did a great job creating characters that have their own personal drama and history with eachother, keeping you engaged and eager to fill in the gaps from the past. This set up led to strong character growth not only for Hollis but also with all the secondary characters -The mother/ daughter relationship was complex but also written realistically. -As per usual, all the Nantucket references from the restaurants, to the landmarks and to the summertime activities, were transportative and picturesque. -The cameos from her previous books, while not as many as in Hotel Nantucket or Golfen Girl, were fun!! Thank you Little Brown and Company for the ARC in exchange for an honest review! Pub date 6/13/23",

I feel that in her other books she is very talented with keeping a wide cast of characters identifiable from one another, but this one I struggled with. I noticed at 60% I was still questioning who was who. I also never developed an attachment to the ladies in this one. I did like the concept of the book. Friends from different seasons of life gathered all together for a fantastic five star weekend. Overall, a miss for me. I will still read her other works",

      "review_text": "Classic Jojo Moyes--funny, touching, and just an all around good story. It starts off as a mix-up. Sam is a married mother of a young adult daughter. Her husband lost his job and his father right around the same time, and he has been in a deep depression ever since. She's the sole breadwinner and exhausted, has a terrible supervisor who makes her feel like she can't do anything right.Nisha is immensely wealthy. An American living in England with her globetrotting husband, their son is in an American boarding school. While at the gym, the two accidentally end up with each other's gym bag.Sam has Nisha's red Christian Louboutin shoes, and because she has to go to a business meeting right away, she wears them. The shoes give her a newfound confidence and she rocks her meetings.Nisha on the other hand, has nothing to wear and is frantic to get her things back. As she works her way back to meeting her husband, she discovers that she's been locked out of her place of residence, no access to any money or accounts. What is she supposed to do?There is a lot going on in this book, but I loved the entire thing. It's long, but well worth the time spent on the journey. Moyes' character development is wonderful, I got a real sense of these women who were a lot more complex than they seemed on the surface. There's a very thoughtful examination of the effects of depression on a spouse, marriage, and family. I really felt for Sam as she struggled with trying to be supportive, but losing herself in the process. She made both good and not-so-good choices, but isn't that realistic? I didn't relate as well to Nisha, but as her character unfolded I could understand her and the decisions she made more and more. The supporting characters really shine as well, I loved Jasmine and Andrea and their roles in the story were needed and made this more of a well-rounded tale. I ended the book with a smile on my face and felt very satisfied with the way all of the storylines converged and concluded. I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",

I wanted milk toast Sam to grow a backbone a little sooner and Nisha\u2026I typically love the ice queen character everyone else hates, but her redemption effort felt a little weak. And the whole scene where they stole the shoes back felt very slapstick.I appreciated the female forward character efforts and interactions, but couldn\u2019t help but notice a relationship with a new man was still part of the happy ending. Which is fine. But it didn\u2019t match what felt like one of the main threads the author seemed to be trying to loom together. All in all, a decent-ish read. But what with the length and this author\u2019s former huge hits, I guess I expected more.And PS the whole fateful shoe switch/working as a maid and suddenly having all these friends rushing to your aid felt very late 90\u2019s/early 2000\u2019s romcom.",

      "review_text": "This book was a massive departure from Jojo Moyes usual books. It was\"too much\" of everything. It tried to be serious, comical, romantic, a bit of mystery, a bit of girl-boss-power all in one. If I could give a perfect summation: I liked the beginning, the end, but didn't care for most of the middle. Not much happens, but when it does, it\u2019s 300 pages of repetitive incidences and emotions.This is the story of Sam and Nisha--two middle aged women stuck in loveless marriages. When Sam accidentally picks up Nisha's gym back, she is left with her very high, expensive Loubouton shoes. She has an important meeting at work and has no other choice but to wear these crazy wild shoes. Nisha is in the midst of chaos, when her husband shuts her out of their hotel room and cuts her out of all his money. What ensues is two women ruffling through life, carrying their problems and the shoe, connecting them in unexpected ways. There are triggering plot points of depression, suicide, and divorce. The reviews claim the book is funny, but I found it serious, sad, and slow. Too many things were happening at one time and it was hard to connect to any character or the overall story. Sam, married to a depressed husband seemed impatient and lacked understanding. Nisha seemed spoiled and elitist. When things went disarray in their lives, it was hard to exhume sympathy. I continued reading, found the ending to have a good moral resolution, which made for a decent read, just not memorable. Overall 3/5 stars",

The two women who end up with the wrong gym bag, Nisha and Samantha (Sam), experience significant impact in their personal and professional lives.Life is messy, gritty, and fluid with ever-changing demands and situations. Moyes captures the rapidity with which life can throw curveballs.Highly recommend!",

I think it was a taaaaaaaad bit long, but the ending was validating! There is a bit of romance, mystery, heartbreak, self discovery, and friendship.

      "review_text": "\"...Strength- real strength is not doing what someone asks you, necessarily. Strength is turning up everyday to a situation that is intolerable, unbearable even just to support the people you love...\"  Huh so that was wasted potential. It sure is interesting. C'mon two women- one rich and the other struggling to get by, both with problems of their own end up accidentally exchanging their bags at the gym and then the whole story revolves around a pair of heels. Initially, am liking  Sam,  cause she seems grounded and her struggles seem realistic.  Nisha  on the other hand came across as a stereotypical rich brat. I thought there lay character development for both of them, but sadly that wasn't the case.  \"When we're low it can be easy to see everything through a prism of negativity. Human beings are remarkably bad at understanding other people's motivations, even when they know them terribly well.\" The  pacing of the book is extremely slow.  I was bored in the middle and especially in the second half. Sam and Nisha both lost my interest. These two are  extremely unlikable women,  especially Nisha. Sam continues to stay a pushover and a crybaby. The author midway forgets that Sam struggles with anxiety and that made Sam's character go downhill. Nisha continues to be a brat and constantly looks down on others. She is extremely selfish, imagine abandoning your own child and not even realising it. Look, I get that the women were struggling and the author wanted to generate the whole concept of empathy, through a pair of heels but empathy regardless. But it's not executed right imo. Don't get me wrong,  it is a well written book but it didn't make me feel anything for the characters. It was just words on paper.  The author also tries to generate a feeling of sisterhood and women empowerment but fails. The use of shoes is also an apparent metaphor, one will get that after reading the ending. Nisha wasn't empowering. Sam wasn't empowering. Reading their lack of character growth made reading an exhausting exercise. I skimmed through the last 100 pages. The  ending  was okay, kinda predictable tho. I liked that things fell into place especially for the married couple.  \"But if you cannot change your situation, then you have no choice. You can only change how you think about it.\"  But a  bit of positive points  now. I liked  Phil and how raw his depression and anxiety was depicted.  I liked how true his struggle was and him trying to find a solution for it. I liked how powerful the character growth was for him. His talks with the therapist and at the end finally with Sam made me emotional. What Sam and Phil went through is so true and seen in so many relationships and marriages. Jojo Moyes does a good job at bringing that out. The  most underrated character  would be  Aleks,  I swear he is the only one who made me smile in this depressing book. While he was attempting to make Nisha smile and make things easy for her, he was doing the same for me- making this book slightly easier to read. I loved him and wish there was more of him. The book needed more of him \ud83d\ude2d It does deal with some triggers- depression, anxiety, loss of life, cancer, grief, manipulation.  Overall, could've been executed well. Ironically, for a book about women empowerment, it was the men who came out on top \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

That was my impression of this book-which isn\u2019t the typical \u201ctear jerker\u201d we have come to expect from this author! Sam Kemp has accidentally taken Nisha Cantor\u2019s gym bag-and inside it are the red shoes mentioned, which are about to change two women\u2019s lives. As the sole breadwinner in her family, and one with an ABUSIVE BOSS, Sam cannot show up for an important meeting in flip flops, and there is no time to turn around and return the gym, so she will have to LITERALLY wear another woman\u2019s shoes to her meeting. Turns out, the sexy shoes end up giving her a boost of confidence that she needed. When she does return to the gym to exchange the gym bag and shoes, for her own, she finds that it has been closed down. The owner of the shoes, Nisha Cantor is left standing in a bathrobe and flip flops, with a knock off of her designer bag. She entered the gym as the pampered wife of a wealthy globetrotting husband-but finds out as she exits, that she has been locked out of the hotel\u2019s penthouse suite, and cut off from ALL of her money and credit. Her husband won\u2019t answer her calls. She devises a plan to get a job in \u201chousekeeping\u201d so she can get into the suite and retrieve what is rightfully hers. But, it won\u2019t be that simple, and she will have to FIGURATIVELY walk in the shoes of the women she has taken for granted her entire life, aided by Jasmine, the kind-hearted housekeeper who trains her for her new job. Both women will grow from their experiences, and the hi-jinks that ensue from Nisha\u2019s attempts to get back her life, and those RED SHOES will lighten up the chapters which thoughtfully deal with the challenges that Sam is facing which include SEXISM at work, a friend with CANCER and a husband battling DEPRESSION. Strong women and friendships are positives as well.Despite the book being a bit predictable, and a bit too long (448 pages or 12 1/2 hours of listening at 1.4x speed) I did find it to be enjoyable, and the AUDIBLE performance was entertaining! A buddy read with DeAnn. Be sure to watch for her amazing review for additional thoughts on this one! A thank you to the Chandler Public library for the loan of this AUDIBLE title! AVAILABLE NOW!",

I mean, let\u2019s talk about the characters in this book: middle-aged, women, multicultural, and stronger than anyone gives them credit for being!!! They are not beautiful, shiny, perfect women. They are real. Flawed. A Single mom. A trophy wife. A cancer patient. A boring, basic, overworked, self-deprecating mum who is really so very much more. As are all of them. This may be my favorite of hers. And that is quite a statement, as I have never met a Moyes book I didn\u2019t fall instantly in love with! A beautiful, surprising, interesting and enriching read! I\u2019ll just say it. It\u2019s fucking great!!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udcda",

      "review_text": "Having loved this author\u2019s previous work, I jumped at the chance to read this book. This was fluffy, it requires a lot of acceptance of unreal situations occurring at all stages, and very light. I considered giving up at some stages, but as it was an audio read it was able to be finished quickly, and I did want to know how these quirky and thrown together group of women ended up.Nisha is rich and successful, seeped in material desire and wanting to look good. Extremely snobby, judgemental, and mean. There was a background to her which possibly showed us why she was this way, but she was hard to take. Married to an awful scum bag wealthy for doing goodness knows what and travelling the world to partake in this \u2018business\u2019. She has an adolescent son who isn\u2019t well, and he\u2019s become collateral damage to this jet setting lifestyle. Poor kid. Sam, such a hard worker, has the sexist boss from hell who undermines her, constantly rude and just awful. Her husband is suffering from depression and unable to work is leaving everything to her including financial, household and everything else. It\u2019s really hard reading about his lack of anything toward his wife who works so hard. A mix up at the gym transpires this story into the farcical, Sam takes Nisha\u2019s bag by accident and this triggers events that draw these women together. Predominantly a pair of Louboutin shoes get taken, are used used (and for of course)) and go missing. It\u2019s just quite surreal, really. Nisha ends up completely broke and penniless (the husband has cut her off completely. Awful stuff!). Nisha has to work (gasp) and learns a thing or two here. Jasmine comes to the rescue while Nisha finds her feet, and thus and unlikely friendship/cat and mouse chase in the streets of London ensues. Each woman learns what is important and many life lessons are learned and cherished.Most characters were not nice, the cook in the hotel where Jasmine and Nisha worked was thoughtful and measured, but it was all quite grey. Sam was very open to allowing herself to be trampled upon, and Nisha\u2019s snootiness was awful. These characters did flourish but it was cringeworthy at times. My frustration was mounting and I wanted a cummupance for many!Themes such as female friendships were heartwarming, but it was all very unreal and over the top. A middle of the road read for me. Disappointed I wasn\u2019t captured like the author\u2019s previous works. 2.5\u2605, which is a generous rating. I listened to this on the BorrowBox platform through my public library at 1.5 speed.",

Jojo Moyes needs zero of my help selling her books and since I loved Me Before You, Still Me and One Plus One I am not super interested in dissecting all the reasons this one didn\u2019t work for me. Some books just aren\u2019t for some people and for me that has a lot to do with the characters. I didn\u2019t much care for doormat Sam at all and thought Nisha was a real See You Next Tuesday throughout the entire story (even though an attempt was given at providing her a redemption arc). The plot didn\u2019t really tickle my fancy either and it was waaaaaaay too long (especially when things went all \u201cThree\u2019s Company\u201d while attempting to steal back the shoes in the hotel).

      "review_text": "Who knew that a story revolving around a pair of Christian Louboutin red bottomed shoes would turn out to be SUCH a brilliant book that I didn\u2019t want to put down!Someone Else\u2019s Shoes contains such a rich cast of brilliantly diverse characters, who are developed really well over the length of the story. A day at a London gym changes the path of two women\u2019s lives forever; Sam, a middle aged mother of one, who is the breadwinner for her family. She keeps having run-ins with her new boss Simon and is constantly on edge trying to impress him in fears that she will end up losing her job. Nisha, a slightly younger mother of one. Married to a millionaire and living a life most can only dream of. Multiple houses in different countries. Designer clothes tailored made just for her. It\u2019s a far cry from her working-class upbringing in America. Then in the changing room at the gym, the women accidentally swap bags. Nisha doesn\u2019t notice that the Marc Jacobs bag she swiftly picked up is in fact a fake. Sam finds a Chanel jacket and a pair of Louboutin heels when she opens her gym bag and realises that this is not hers. But as she is on the way to some important meetings for her job, changing out of the flip flops she wore leaving the gym into those designer heels would help her\u2026 Throughout the course of this book, the women\u2019s lives slowly unravel and they are both faced with different adversities as their lives intertwine. Nisha needs those shoes back as part of a divorce settlement with her husband. He is using them as a bargaining chip. Sam tries to return them to the gym where she accidentally picked them up but it has closed down. Things in life are never that simple and there are many twists and turns\u2026 Will Nisha and Sam cross paths? And will they be able to help each other?I empathised a lot with the character of Phil (Sam\u2019s husband). His struggles with symptoms of depression mirrored some of my own. A heavy feeling in the body, it taking an insurmountable amount of effort to get up and do anything throughout the day. Perma-fatigue. I felt emotional reading his therapy scenes, I just wanted to reach out through the pages and give him a hug \ud83e\udd7aMy favourite character was a new friend of Nisha\u2019s that she meets over the course of the story called Jasmine. She is so upbeat and a positive influence. Everybody could do with a friend like Jasmine. I forgot just how much I love Jojo Moyes\u2019 writing style. She is a great storyteller and this has inspired me to finally finish the Me Before You series soon, and also read The Giver Of Stars. (Owned these paperbacks for years now \ud83d\ude05)\u201dStrength \u2014 real strength \u2014 is not doing what someone asks you, necessarily. Strength is turning up every day to a situation that is intolerable, unbearable even, just to support the people that you love.\u201d5 Stars.",

And it could have been five-Stars if I didn't start getting annoyed by the coincidences in this suspension of disbelief novel. Okay, that said, go out and grab a copy of Someone Else's Shoes just to see if you can guess how it turns out.What you'll find is a most unlikely set of circumstances where a wealthy, well-dressed, nasty woman is locked out of everything she has by an evil and hateful husband. Second heroine is a menopausal woman mistreated by a boss from hell and putting up with a depressed husband, two horrendous parents, and a smelly dog.Introduce a pair of 6\" heeled red ostrich Louboutin shoes and we're off. Nisha, the wife, with no money, finds work as a chambermaid in a posh London hotel. Sam, sad sack extraordinaire, picks up the wrong bag, containing not her own shabby shoes, but Nisha's. The problem is, Nisha can't get her divorce settlement without giving her husband back the shoes.So then we get into parenting, friendship, cancer and talk therapy, as well as a hysterical breaking and entering episode. But wait, there's more. It's a real romp. Read and laugh. Thank you thank you to Penguin Division of Random House for allowing me to read this early copy.'",

      "review_text": "Sam Kemp is trying hard to juggle her life. She has a teenage daughter at home as well as an out-of-work husband who is drifting away from her as he sinks into a deep depression. She does a very good job working for a printing company but her new boss finds nothing but faults in her performance. While at a London gym, Sam mistakenly leaves with someone else's look-a-like Marc Jacobs bag. While her bag is a knock-off filled with sensible shoes, the bag she took is the authentic version and is filled not only with a Chanel jacket but an incredible pair of one-of-a-kind Christian Louboutin high-heels. Sam starts wearing the shoes and a new side of her comes out -- one of power and confidence. The true owner of the bag is Nisha Cantor, who is horrified that her shoes are gone and is aghast that she has to wear the worn, flat shoes in the bag she now possesses. But this is just the beginning of Nisha's woes. When Nisha, who is an American, returns to her hotel, she discovers that her wealthy husband Carl has shut her out of their room leaving Nisha with no money, clothes and dignity. His young assistant has taken her place. In order to survive, Nisha becomes a maid in the hotel and is determined to get her life back and find the woman who took her shoes. In Someone Else's Shoes author Jojo Moyes has written an entertaining tale of two 40-something women who, while having very different lives and economic status, shared the reality that they had entered a stage in life where they risked becoming invisible. It's a clever story that has both humor and heart. While I found this fast-paced book to be lots of fun, it also addressed some serious issues such as mental health and discrimination. Moyes created a wonderful cast of supporting characters which added to the appeal - including women who provided friendship and sisterhood to the main characters. Since Moyes' Me Before You was one of the most sob-inducing books I've ever read, it was nice to not need a box of tissues this time.Rated 4.5 stars.Review posted on MicheleReader.com.",

      "review_text": "3.5 starsLondon printing company saleswoman Sam Kemp was given a one-day gift pass to a high-end gym. Since the pass is about to expire, Sam decides to use it one morning before a series of sales calls. At the facility, there's a mix-up in the locker room, and Sam grabs a lookalike gym bag on her way out, leaving her own gym bag behind.Riding to to her first meeting with several colleagues, Sam reaches into the gym bag for her shoes, and instead of her sensible black pumps, Sam finds red Louboutin sling-backs with four inch heels. Sam can't go to a sales meeting in flip-flops, so she dons the Louboutins and finds that the sexy shoes fascinate clients and help with sales. This is important to Sam because she has a new boss, a nasty misogynist named Simon who's ALWAYS on Sam's case.Simon constantly says Sam can't do anything right and insinuates she's dispensable. Sam can't lose her job because she's currently the family's sole breadwinner. Sam's husband Phil - who recently lost his father and his job - just sits on the sofa and watches television. Phil is clinically depressed, but he refuses to take medication or get help. Thus Sam has to do EVERYTHING: support herself, Phil, and their teenage daughter; walk and feed the family dog; keep up the house; shop for groceries; prepare meals; pay the bills; and so on. Sam also has to help her retired parents, who expect her to clean their house; shop for them; and see to all their eccentric whims. On top of all that, Sam's best friend Andrea has been diagnosed with cancer, and is currently undergoing treatment.Though Sam is overwhelmed with worries and responsibilities, she plans to return the gym bag - and the Louboutins - as soon as she gets a chanceOn the morning of the gym bag switch, the owner of the Louboutins, an American woman named Nisha Cantor, is horrified to be stuck with Sam's bag, which Nisha thinks is full of germs; nasty skin cells; bad smells; and the like. And that's just the beginning of Nisha's horrible day. Nisha has been married to wealthy business executive Carl Cantor for eighteen years, and for the entire time, Nisha has been the 'perfect wife.' Nisha is beautiful, elegant, cultured, and goes everywhere with Carl, whose business interests require constant travel. As a result, Nisha and Carl's troubled teenage son is at a boarding school in America, where he's lonely and unhappy. Boarding school was Carl's idea, and Nisha reluctantly agreed, since keeping Carl happy is always her first priority. While Nisha and Carl are in London, they reside in the penthouse of an elegant hotel.On the day of the gym bag switch, Nisha returns to the hotel and finds that her life is about to be completely upended. Carl has informed the hotel staff that Nisha is not permitted to enter the penthouse under any circumstances, not even to get her clothes (all designer labels of course). In addition, Carl has cancelled all Nisha's credit cards and completely blocked her access to funds. In short, Nisha has NOTHING. It's clear Carl has decided to divorce Nisha, and has been planning this move for a long time.As the story unfolds we follow Sam and Nisha's arcs.Sam struggles along with her awful boss, who makes her feel completely cowed at work. Sam does get support from her co-workers, especially a sympathetic man named Joel, which results in an emotional affair. As for Sam's home situation, she tries hard to pull her husband Phil out of the doldrums. However Phil doesn't respond to Sam's entreaties, and he can't seem to understand how badly he's damaging the marriage. In the meanwhile, disenfranchised Nisha accidently gets a cleaning job in the hotel where Carl still resides. As Nisha goes about her work she makes friends with some fellow hotel employees, especially a maid called Jasmine..... .....and a hotel chef called Alex. Both Jasmine and Alex help Nisha in her darkest days.Eventually Sam and Nisha's storylines come together, and all the ladies - Sam, Nisha, cancer patient Andrea, and hotel maid Jasmine - cooperate to rectify some wrongs. \ud83d\ude42I enjoyed the novel, which has drama, comedy, and interesting characters.I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Daisy Ridley, who does a fine job.You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/",

      "review_text": "The New York Times had it right when it talked about JoJo Moyes being known for her \u201cterrifically funny tearjerkers about woman trapped in sticky situations. Very few authors have the power to make you laugh and one page and cry on the next.\u201d That is exactly what happened to me during the course of this novel. At one point my shoulders were heaving as I sobbed and another point, I was smiling like a Cheshire cat. Yes, this was exactly what the doctor ordered for me right now. I was looking for that brain candy that I could lose myself in and yet appreciate quick dialogue, incisive characters and a plot that would sweep me along. Who cares if the plot has some absurdities? It all just worked terrifically in the flow of the story. Following the mad capers and suspending belief made this a perfect read for a plane ride, a beach getaway or just sitting in your home having a jolly good time. Literally, two women, Sam and Nisha end up in each other\u2019s shoes when they mistakenly take each other\u2019s gym bags. Nisha, the privileged wife of a wealthy husband with homes on different continents and a closet full of designer clothes finds herself homeless and penniless after returning from the gym and finding her husband has cut her off from all her accounts assailing her out of the blue. Sam can\u2019t return the shoes because the gym has shut down but when she tries on Nisha\u2019s designer shoes, she feels empowered. Madcap adventures ensue in Nisha trying to secure her shoes, but with acute and piercing revelations about female friendship, aging women and power, vindictiveness, and love. It is about the power of female friendships then can bridge differences and find that common ground. I know this world. And you will want to too!! Run for this one!",

      "review_text": "\u201cStrength is turning up every day to a situation that is intolerable, unbearable even, just to support the people you love.\u201d\n\nActual Rating: 4.5 StarsI have read a few Moyes books and enjoyed them. In \"Someone Else's Shoes\" Jojo Moyes invites readers on a poignant journey of empathy and understanding, weaving together the lives of disparate characters with finesse and heart. Moyes, known for her ability to craft compelling narratives rich in emotion, delivers once again but with a different kind of stories this time. Set against the backdrop of contemporary society, the story unfolds through multiple perspectives, each offering a unique lens through which to view the world. Moyes skillfully delves into the complexities of human experience, highlighting the interconnectedness of lives often overlooked.At the heart of the novel lies a simple yet profound question: What if we could truly understand what it means to walk in someone else's shoes? Through her vivid portrayal of characters grappling with their own challenges and triumphs, Moyes challenges readers to confront their preconceptions and embrace the power of empathy.\n\n\u201cBut if you cannot change your situation, then you have no choice. You can only change how you think about it.\u201d\n\nOne of the novel's greatest strengths is its ability to evoke a range of emotions, from laughter to tears and everything in between. Moyes' writing is both evocative and empathetic, drawing readers into the lives of her characters with empathy and compassion. Reading this felt like watching a movie, I had to do a simple Google search and I was right, apparently Moyes is also a screenwriter and I somehow missed that, but I could feel it when I read this story. It just feels like it was written as a movie script but in a very good way.While \"Someone Else's Shoes\" tackles weighty themes such as social inequality, mental health, and the search for connection, it does so with a lightness of touch that never feels heavy-handed. Moyes' prose is imbued with warmth and humanity, making even the most difficult moments resonate with authenticity and grace. In the end, \"Someone Else's Shoes\" is a testament to the power of storytelling to bridge divides and foster understanding. Moyes reminds us that while we may never truly walk in someone else's shoes, we can strive to listen, to empathize, and to recognize the shared humanity that binds us all. With its compelling characters and heartfelt narrative, this novel is sure to leave a lasting impression on readers long after they've turned the final page.",

      "review_text": "My Reviews Can Also Be Found On:\n\n Twitter - Amazon - Storygraph - The Book Review Crew2.5 StarsAlice Hoffman is a beautiful writer, and of that there is no doubt. This one is about a cult and a young girl who escapes it because of her love of adventure and books (which aren't allowed on the compound). The book started off well enough and had so much potential. There is a lot of love throughout these pages and I so enjoyed reading Ivy and her daughter Mia's story. But when the plot veered into Nathanial Hawthorn territory I became bored. As much as I like time travel stories this one just didn't do it for me. Maybe I am just not smart enough for this type of book. The second half feels like a different book altogether.The book tries too hard to fit many genres into too few pages. Is it fantasy, literary fiction, women's fiction or a thriller? I think it got a bit watered down trying to be too much at once. It is a well-written story and Hoffman's prose is front and center, the premise is a good one. Unfortunately, the bad/boring parts overrode the good. 2.5 stars rounded down.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.",

      "review_text": "3.5\u2b50\ufe0f As the novel begins, we meet fifteen-year-old Mia Jacob as she plans her escape from the oppressive cult in western Massachusetts, where she has spent all her young life. Mia was born to Ivy Jacob, a teenager from an affluent family in Boston who left when pregnant with Mia and joined the community headed by Joel Davis whom Ivy later marries- a decision she soon comes to regret. Joel is controlling and life in the commune is governed by strict rules and regulations and minimal contact with the outside world and those found guilty of any indiscretion are severely punished. Mia has broken the rules by visiting the library on the sly and reading books. On one of her visits, Mia finds an old copy of The Scarlett Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne in the library and falls in love with the story, which she finds bears similarity to her mother\u2019s life and is intrigued by the inscription inside the book. When tragedy strikes, Mia finds no reason to remain with the cult. The narrator follows Mia as forges a new life for herself with the help of Sarah, the town librarian. Her love for books and reading remains a driving force in her life. However, Joel never backs down from his pursuit of Mia. In a surprising turn of events, adult Mia finds herself transported to 1837, where she meets young author Nathaniel Hawthorne \u2013 a meeting that would irrevocably impact the lives of both Mia and the young author.Revolving around themes of mother-daughter relationships, found family, women\u2019s rights, hope, healing and the power of books, The Invisible Hour by Alice Hoffman is a beautifully penned novel. However, I enjoyed the premise of this story more than the execution. I really liked the protagonist and the supporting female characters. I loved how the author depicts the transformative power of books and how Mia finds inspiration and hope through her love for reading. The first half of the novel had me hooked, but my interest waned in the second half. I would have enjoyed this novel more had we spent more time with Mia in the years after she escaped from the cult instead of rushing through it (more telling than showing) to the point when adult Mia traveled back in time. The commentary on women\u2019s rights, both historically and in the present day, was timely and relevant but could have been presented better if more deeply embedded in the narrative. The use of magical realism and the time travel element wasn't as impactful as one would expect.The latter half of the narrative where Mia meets Nathaniel Hawthorne was interesting, but I wasn\u2019t quite invested in this part of the story. The past and present timelines felt a tad disjointed, resulting in a narrative that lacked both cohesion and depth. Overall, while I did not dislike the story, I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped.I must mention the author\u2019s exquisitely penned, heartfelt letter to the reader where she talks about her inspiration for this novel and much more.Many thanks to Atria Books and NetGalley for the digital review copy of The Invisible Hour.

      "review_text": "I was touched to read Alice Hoffman\u2019s letter to her readers at the beginning of this novel. \u201cThe bond between writer and reader is a cherished and mysterious one. A book doesn\u2019t live when it\u2019s written. It lives when it\u2019s read.\u201d What a perfectly beautiful thing to say as this book is in many ways a ode to the powers of books and how they touch people\u2019s lives. In this particular novel, it\u2019s about how a one novel saved the life of a young woman living in a cult where reading was forbidden. As in a number of her other novels, there\u2019s an element of magic. It\u2019s through time travel in this story. Yes, of course you have to suspend your disbelief for a while to experience the modern day character connecting with and falling in love with her favorite writer. But for an avid reader, things don\u2019t get any better than to imagine that. It\u2019s clear from the beginning that there is a reflection on issues that are very relevant right now - book banning, the freedom of women to choose. A message here, for sure, but it\u2019s an engaging, well written story . I always find Hoffman\u2019s writing magical no matter what the story is about.

      "review_text": "\"Books may well be the only true magic.\" - Alice HoffmanAnother enchanting book by Alice Hoffman! What an absolute pleasure this book was! I was instantly drawn into this gripping tale about love, family, finding your family, sacrifice, survival, strength, the love of reading, the power of books and the plight of women.Ivy left her home after receiving poor reactions from both her family and her unborn baby's father. She runs away looking for a better life, what she finds is a \"community\" with a charismatic leader who turns out to be a wolf in disguise. The community she has joined is a cult in western Massachusetts where books are not allowed, and babies are taken from their mother's and raised in the Nursery. Ivy is crafty and finds time to bond with her daughter Mia. Mia has inherited her mother's love of reading and finds ways to obtain books - one which will save her and change her life in so many ways....Hoffman also shows what life was like for women in the past, the choices they had to make, the expectations that were placed upon them and how they were living in a man's world. She also shows the power of books and the written word. Books transport readers, comfort, provide food for thought, educate, evoke emotions and so much more. I have always enjoyed Hoffman's writing and in this book, she is at the top of her game as Mia goes back in time to meet the author whose book saved her life! As always, her writing was beautiful and vividly descriptive. She weaves a little bit of her own magic into this book, and I had no problem taking that leap into the past. Beautifully written, gripping, and hard to put down!Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

      "review_text": "\"Real life is unbelievable. Souls are snatched away from us, flesh and blood turn to dust, people you love betray you, men go to war over nothing. It's all preposterous. That's why we have novels. To make sense of things.\"The Invisible Hour is a book about a book. It tells the captivating story about a young girl, Mia Jacob, who was raised in a cult that separates children from their mothers, punishes members who rebel against the leader, forbids contact with the outside world, dictates what women can do with their bodies, and bans reading any books. \"In a place where books were banned, there could be no personal freedom, no hope, and no dreams for the future.\" Mia, ever rebellious, sneaks into the local public library on numerous occasions. She is befriended by the kind librarian. After finding an original copy of The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne with the inscription \"To Mia\" she no longer wants to kill herself. She recognizes it tells the story of her own beloved mother, Ivy. Mia gathers her strength and escapes the community. The evil community leader continues to hunt and taunt her throughout her life, hindering her personal development. Mia is able to break the boundaries of time and reach out to her beloved author before The Scarlet Letter has been written. In this journey of self-discovery and self-empowerment of women, Mia learns the eternal truth that love is stronger than any chains of past bondage. Alice Hoffman is such a gifted writer. I was moved by her author's note when she states \"A book doesn't live when it's written. It lives when it is read.\" No wonder I am so enchanted by her stories. 4.5-stars, rounded up.",

      "review_text": "2.5 starsWhat happened? I adore Alice Hoffman, but I feel like something went really wrong with The Invisible Hour. It\u2019s not up to her usual snuff.Hoffman\u2019s signature magical realism is there: a woman escapes the cult she was born into, finds refuge in books and libraries, and then travels back in time to when Nathaniel Hawthorne was a young writer. Ever present, too, are her whimsical prose and astute observations on life and love. Her latest release should\u2019ve been a dream come true for a Hoffman fan like me.The problem is that the book is too slim. The Invisible Hour is much shorter than many of her other novels, and I wonder if she thought it\u2019d have more of a fairy tale feel if she kept the page count low. But by doing this, so much depth is lost. The plot is rushed and underdeveloped, and the characterization is flat. There\u2019s no substance to any of it.I did appreciate the main theme of the story, about how books can be our saving grace. They sure do help us through tough times, don\u2019t they? And I should note that the first half of the novel is far better than the second half. But there\u2019s not much else positive I can say.Now to remove the dagger from my heart.My sincerest appreciation to Alice Hoffman, Atria Books, and Edelweiss+ for the digital review copy.

      "review_text": "in every fairy tale girl who is saved is the one who rescues herself.\n--------------------------------------\n people in love were such fools, they made up excuses, they wound up doing as they pleased no matter how much good advice they been given. \nThe Invisible Hour is a twice-told tale of a mother and a daughter.Ivy Jacobs\u2019 Beacon Hill family did not exactly treat it as a crimson-letter day when the sixteen-year-old informed her parents that she was pregnant by a feckless Harvard sophomore. Despite her tender years, Ivy wanted to see the pregnancy through and keep the baby. Decisions and plans were made, none of them involving input from Ivy. The newborn would be put up for adoption. Ivy bails, getting as far away as she can, which turns out to be a sort-of commune in western Massachusetts.Alice Hoffman - image from Penguin Random House - shot by Alyssa PeekMia Jacob is the daughter Ivy bore. We meet her at 15. Living in the place to which her mother had fled, The Community. More of a cult really, an authoritarian farm where the leader\u2019s will is law. Joel Davis took Ivy in, married her soon after she\u2019d arrived, so is Mia\u2019s step-father. But child-rearing is communal here, so parenting is not what you or I would recognize. You will recognize the cult-leader, control-freak personality Joel wears like the headgear sported by the  QAnon Shaman. Vanity is supposedly being punished, but it is accomplishment, growth, intelligence and independence that are the targets. He likes his followers unquestioning and compliant. Ivy has stolen parenting moments over the years, so has had a hand in helping Mia find her true self, a young woman who is curious about the world, eager to learn, to investigate, to explore, to read. Discovery of her criminal reading marks her for punishment. When we meet Mia she is, as her mother was, a teen about to flee her oppressive environment. Although we learn about and spend time with both women, it is Mia who is our primary focus. In a dark time, she considers suicide, but, fortuitously, reads a book that saves her, changing her life, giving her hope, The Scarlet Letter. We follow her coming of age, assisted by her mother and an understanding librarian in the town where The Community sells their produce. Her passion for Hawthorne is such that she finds in it a magical power. Alice Hoffman loves her some fairy tales, so it will come as no great shock that one fine day Mia finds herself transported back to the 19th century, and into the presence of her literary love object. Complications ensue. In those, however, we get a sense of Hawthorne, his personality, his material conditions, his family and friends, and his writing challenges. Nice looking fellah, too, to go with that oversized talent. There is some wonderful imagery woven into the novel. The notion of invisibility is large among these. There are times in which it might be useful to go unseen, as in when one is doing something for which one might be punished, or which are simply secret. On the other hand, it is not so wonderful to be unseen in normal human interactions. Like \u201cYo, dude, human here. Whaddaya? Blind?\u201d There is some literal invisibility as well.Apples are a core element as well. There is a particular breed of apple grown in the area, which is no Eden. They seem less associated with The Fall than with a push. Joel uses leaves of that apple tree as a threat. One could certainly see his actions as serpentine. Mia even decides never to eat apples, given the associations she has for them with The Community.  Howdaya like dem apples? Johnny Appleseed comes in for some attention, with plantings of his effort bearing local fruit.The woods as a magical place gets a visit or two. Indeed, magical things go on there. Strange people and buildings appear. There is even one \u201cOnce upon a time\u201d in the book. The Woods is where Mia goes to escape.Much of the tension in the book centers around women taking control of their own lives. This happens in various ways. There is the usual disobedience one would expect, with the most daring taking the greatest risks. Reading figures large in this, as subservience is sustained under the lash of forced-ignorance. Reading is the gateway drug to independent thinking, and dreaming of better. Some women even learn herbal medicine, to see to their needs. The comparisons of the modern day with the repressive Puritan world depicted in The Scarlet Letter are clearly drawn. Plus \u00e7a change\u2026\nI think it's a bad idea to write for the moment because the moment passes so quickly. The other thing about time is that what's right and what's good and what's accepted suddenly becomes not. I thought about that with the way women were treated in \"The Scarlet Letter,\" the way that the Puritans blamed women, and they believed in original sin and that women were responsible for that because of Eve. It all changed, but then it changes back. And then it changes again. A lot of the things that women are coping with right now are not that different, really. The judgment against women. - from the Salon interviewThere is a garden in town where all the plants are red. It may feel familiar to frequent readers of Hoffman. \nThis new book [The Invisible Hour] actually takes place in a town where I wrote a book of connecting stories about called The Red Garden, so it's the same place. It's just a novel that takes place in that town. - from the Salon interviewI consider myself an Alice Hoffman fan. While I have not read all her books, I have certainly read more than a couple. Any reader of her books knows that there are certain things one can expect. Among other things, there will be an engaging lead, facing difficult choices, and there will usually be bits, at least, of magic, often of a fairy tale sort.\t So, one cannot really gripe about a time-travel element pushing things too far, particularly when done in the service of giving us a closer look at a literary icon. My sole gripe is that I felt that the baddie was given too much magical license to pursue his dark ends. Otherwise, despite it\u2019s title, The Invisible Hours very much deserves to be seen. It offers not only an uplifting, engaging tale of empowerment, but an homage to one of the greats of American literature, and long-form praise of the power, the importance, the necessity of reading. I am sure we can all see the value in that. \n\u201cQ: Did you set out to write a novel so deeply rooted in women\u2019s empowerment? How did it evolve to include time travel?\u201d\u201cA: I started to think about The Scarlet Letter and how modern-day issues for women are not that foreign from issues in that time period. I\u2019m not certain I realized when I first read Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s great novel what the deeper meaning of his heroine\u2019s situation is\u2014she has no say over her body or her choices and yet, she does make her own choices. It\u2019s a very brave book.I\u2019ve always wanted to time travel and been drawn to books about time travel. I think during the time of Covid, when I was writing this, more than ever I want it to be in another time period.\u201d - from A Conversation with Alice Hoffman, an appendix in the book  Review posted - 12/22/23Publication date \u2013 8/15/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review is cross-posted on my site, Coot\u2019s Reviews.

      "review_text": "I will confess to being a huge Alice Hoffman fan. And no wonder, when she writes books like The Invisible Hour. It\u2019s a story about the power of books, the strength of a mother\u2019s love and the beauty of a found family. It\u2019s an ode to librarians. As always, the writing is beautiful. This starts as just a regular cult story. A young pregnant woman runs away from her family and ends up at a cult based commune in Western Massachusetts. A community that demands total obedience to its rules, including banning reading fiction. As the town librarian thinks \u201cin a place where books were banned there could be no personal freedom, no hope, and no dreams for the future\u201d. The woman becomes the wife of the cult leader and eventually gives birth to a baby girl. Going against the rules, she teaches her daughter the joys of reading and her daughter discovers the town library. In particular, she develops an intense love of the book, The Scarlet Letter. The bulk of the story covers the daughter, Mia and her fight to be her own person. Then the book makes an abrupt shift for the second half and here\u2019s where Hoffman\u2019s magical realism comes in. We are transported back to Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s time. I didn\u2019t feel the ending held together as well as I would have liked, but loved the book up until the last few pages. The book is a reminder that too often, throughout the years, women don\u2019t get a say over their bodies or their lives. My thanks to Netgalley and Atria Books for an advance copy of this book.",

      "review_text": "I\u2019m a huge fan of Alice Hoffman and there\u2019s always a delicious sense of anticipation when there\u2019s a new book on the horizon and with this latest novel she yet again draws me effortlessly in and enchants me.Ivy Jacobs is an outsider, she\u2019s highly intelligent and an independent thinker, a lover of books but she\u2019s very unhappy. When her rebellious behaviour, as her parents view it, leads to pregnancy, she\u2019s dismissed and abandoned. By a series of chances she finds her way to the West Massachusetts Community, a cult led by Joel Davis, whom Ivy marries a few months later. Sixteen years on, her daughter Mia is stuck, trapped inside this oppressive cult where she\u2019s been punished many times for her perceived transgressions especially her love of books which are banned. The book that saves her life is The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, a novel from 1850 that understands her story and literally speaks to her. Let the magic begin.The harsh cult is very well conveyed with all its austere and repressive rules which contrasts so sharply with the wonderful spirits of mother and daughter and the things they cannot repress. All the characters are deftly portrayed with a few brush strokes you can visualise them with ease. I love both mother and daughter but Mia in particular, I love her independence of spirit and thought with her love of books being a given! Her connection to The Scarlet Letter takes the storytelling in a fascinating direction. I find I can totally buy into the magical elements and delight in how Nathaniel Hawthorne is woven so cleverly and movingly into the story. Via Nathaniel, Mia goes on a journey of discovery, she is able to come to many a realisation, learning some valuable life lessons. I like how we can see the situation for women in the mid nineteenth century and there are some dualities with difficulties faced today. This is a wonderfully creative novel with some beautiful prose and I guess I expected nothing less from Alice Hoffman! I become utterly caught up in the plot direction especially the theme of the power and magic of books - as book lovers, how can we deny this??!! Books can offer a portal to a fantastical world and many do indeed speak to us as The Scarlet Letter does for Mia. Although there is a cult element and Joel continues to feature, this is a book about love, the unbreakable bond of a mother\u2019s love for a child and of finding love wherever and whenever you can. It\u2019s a beautiful captivating story with a powerful message by a gifted writer. Highly recommended. With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Simon and Schuster for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.",

Now available as of 8.15!!**\nA high-concept journey of magical realism in the literary sphere that got MORE than a bit lost in translation...\nIvy has always been a bit of a rebel, a free spirit, and most of all, a lover of books. Her cold and judgmental parents have no room for anything they deem a transgression, however, so when Ivy ends up pregnant as a teenager, they send her away. Ivy ends up as a member of a harsh and oppressive cult, led by the unyielding Joel Davis, who has no problem shaming women and even branding them when they behave outside the norm.When Ivy's daughter Mia comes of age, she has inherited her mother's love for the written word and her rebellious nature and dreams of freedom. When she picks up Nathanial Hawthorne's book The Scarlet Letter, it seems as though every page is written just for her. In its pages, another young woman is persecuted for her transgressions, including her penchant for books. Mia longs for life outside her Community and wishes for some way --- ANY way --- to be free.Then suddenly...\nshe gets her wish.\nMia is transported back in time, and comes face to face with none other than the man of her proverbial dreams: Nathanial Hawthorne himself. As she has come to learn with the help of a few librarians over time, books can take you anywhere...but is Mia able to stay in this fantasy? When the line between dream and reality begins to blur entirely, will the truth she finds be enough to make up for the terrible tragedies and pain she has encountered thus far? Could a book TRULY be enough to save her very life?Hoffman is one of those writers I've been meaning to get to for AGES, and the premise sounded so fascinating that I couldn't resist to pick this up. I read the Scarlet Letter in high school and remember being enough of a fan that I could understand Mia's adulation for Hawthorne in this book, and I put my usual reservations about cult books aside long enough to try to dive into this story without hesitation. And it worked...for a while. The beginning of the narrative, about Ivy's backstory and early years in the cult (prior to Mia's teen years) were dark, dramatic, and engaging. I felt sorry for the situation Ivy endured, and got emotionally invested in pretty short order.But once Mia took over...things started to descend into muddled and messy territory, and the wheels sort of came off the wagon.I get that Mia was supposed to be enraptured by Hawthorne...but I don't understand exactly WHY he was so taken with her. The romance part of the book felt so forced, and longer than it needed to be. There were even portions told from Hawthorne's POV, but it felt more like Hoffman was determined to sprinkle in all of her research rather than create her version of Hawthorne as a fully fleshed out person. On top of this, Hoffman wrote this as sort of a 'love letter' to libraries and librarians, which in theory is a beautiful idea...but having this sort of juxtaposed against the love story between Mia and Nathan just sort of muddled the overall message.There have been many instances where I've struggled with magical realism, but in this one I think so much of the magic felt like it just sort of happened randomly, without provocation, that it lost the 'realism.' Hoffman spends SO much of this book telling rather than showing, and this also bothered me. Gentle and thoughtful lines of prose were broken up by expository passages that just sort of moved the plot along...and often without thorough explanation.The timeline sort of moves around, the focus moves around...and for several reasons, Ivy's voice (the driving force behind the opening narrative) gets lost entirely. Instead of a now and then that felt so close in time, I think it would have been fascinating to have Mia's perspective take place during modern times, and CLEARLY during modern times. There often felt like there wasn't enough separation or clarity about what year we were in at any given moment and this book sorely needed it. While I hoped to feel moved, enchanted, and captivated by Hoffman's brand of magic, I think in this case I would have settled for something a bit more, well, \"Practical.\"\ud83d\ude093.5 stars",

Her Harvard student boyfriend only cares about his own future. Her parents plan to send her to a school in Utah where she'll give birth and give the baby up for adoption. Ivy decides to run away in the middle of the night when she met a girl who's heading to a \"wonderful\" community in western Massachusetts.Ivy had her baby, Mia. The wonderful community turns out to be a cult with a typical atrocious male leader and typical cult rules. It was half gripping, half predictable. There's a time-traveling aspect that I thought was cleverly woven into the story in relation to a book from the 1850s that saves Mia from the life she's born into.The Invisible Hour is an atmospheric, thought-provoking, and enchanting novel that draws in the power of literature and love. I love the message of healing and self-discovery. I just wish the second half kept me engaged as much as the first. Overall, an enjoyable read but not my favorite from Alice Hoffman. I thought the author's note was very special and shouldn't be missed. 3.5\u2b50Thank you Atria Books and Netgalley for my DRC",

Interaction with the outside world, education, and reading are forbidden after members turn fifteen. Women who fail to obey the rigid rules set by its despotic leader must wear letters around their necks and/or branded on their arms.

Poof!\u00a0Mia finds herself transported to 1837 Salem, MA.\u201cI came from another time only to meet you,\u201d she tells him and they fall rapturously in love.

Hmmm.What if their meeting and ensuing love affair is what propelled him to write his masterpiece, ultimately dedicating it to her?You know I\u2019m a rabid Alice Hoffman fan, so it pains me to say that The Invisible Hour is not her finest offering.It\u2019s okay, but another book I read this year with a character based upon Nathaniel Hawthorne is the historical fiction novel Hester by Laurie Lico Albanese, which I enjoyed much more.Still, fans of Hoffman will find her familiar theme of women\u2019s rights and autonomy deeply present throughout the novel. She also drives home the point that frighteningly little has changed on that front\u00a0in almost 200 years. Book banning also plays a role in the story and the transformative magic of literature and its ability to transcend time.There\u2019s definitely a timely lesson to be learned here, too: it\u2019s always the despotic people in charge who want to ban the books.",

Like the heroine of Hoffman\u2019s novel, I first fell under the spell of \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d as an adolescent, obsessed as only an innocent teenager can be with the horror of my unspeakable sins.

      "review_text": "Hoffman touches on some important talking points. She covers patriarchy, oppression, sexism, and time travel. Into all 270 pages\u2014 of this poignant novel\u2014 She has proven that less is more. You don't need a 400-page book to tell a beautifully written story. The author does a fabulous job of showing the importance of literature throughout society. At the same time, she showcases to the readers the profound healing powers that reading books can provide. I always say reading is my therapy.The book is divided into three parts to track the different timelines of the characters\u2014Ivy and Mia's story. Ivy is a young unwed woman who falls in with a cult run by a man named Joel, who will also become Mia's \"father and her abusive husband . As Mia grows up, she is more and more constrained, and she begins to rebel against the harsh rules governed within the \"community\" especially the one that forbids the reading of books. Mia sneaks into the town library. She falls in love with literature as she discovers the Scarlet Letter and is amazed by its beauty and power\u2014the librarian behind her. The friendship enriches Mia's life. Towards the end, Mia forges forward to create a better life for herself and her family. The second part of the novel has Mia travel back in time to where Nathaniel Hawthorne is a struggling writer, where he and Mia meet and fall in love. The novel's third part is a harmonious blending of the present and past.Women play a central role in the book, flowing seamlessly through the past and present; it touches on men's terrible treatment of women throughout history and how the power should shift back to women.I loved the first and third parts of the book; the most. I didn't care for the second half's slower pace and Mia's time travel back to the past. My only minor issue is that one will have to suspend their disbelief to make the entirety of the plot plausible, which didn't distract from me thoroughly enjoying it. I just went with it and enjoyed the incredible journey  This book is about how books empower your life and the freedom that knowledge can give you. It's beautifully written, and the story will stay with me for quite some time. I found this to be a poignant enthralling read. I highly recommend you read this book; if you're a fan of historical fiction and enjoy magical realism in your books. You won't be disappointed; I suggest you clear your calendars before reading. This book deserves all the stars!!!

      "review_text": "I loved it up until the middle where a transition occurred that seemed so out of the place in the story. This stoy is a hard one to review. In the beginning we fall in love with Ivy, a young girl left pregnant and pretty much bereft of any help. In frustration and fear, she attaches herself to a cult left by a charismatic but evil man, Joel Davis, who eventually seduces and imprisons Ivy in a circle of fear, authoritarian rule, and a community where secrets were often betrayed to their cult leader.Ivy gives birth to a daughter. Mia, and as this girl grows, she feels her life is missing something. At fifteen years of age, while working at a farmers' market, Mia slips off to the library, where a world opened up before her, especially when she secrets away a book, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne which we now know as The Scarlet Letter. So much of her and Ivy's lie seem to be reflected in Hawthorn's writing, that she falls in love, not only with the words but with the author himself.Time travel comes onto the scene, and before one knows it, Mia and Nathaniel meet and fall madly in love. However, can this oddity continue, when Mia is well aware of where Nathaniel's life will go and it's not with her as his bride.I believe what bothered me at this point, (although I am not a fan of time travel,) was the abruptness of the change in Mia's life, and the very weird sensation that this was in no way an authentic happening as much as we may have wanted it to be.Of course Alice Hoffman writes lovely prose and diligently describes beautiful scenery and cherished moments. However, this book just struck me as a way in which to throw remarks about men, (Ivy's boyfriend casts her out when he find her pregnant, and the cult leader was such an evil pervasive character appearing everywhere) as well as women's rights, and other topics du jour. Many others enjoyed this foray into the past and tripping back to the present, but for me it was a tad disappointing.",

      "review_text": "Today was a frigid day to stay indoors and read. I started and finished my first Alice Hoffman book, The Invisible Hour. I knew little about it. I know the author is famous for her magical realism novels. Books about real witches is something I won\u2019t read. This is more of a spiritual based read based on those that dare to live outside of societies standards of the time. Mia reads Nathaniel Hawthorn\u2019s novels and falls in love. She travels back in time where they fall in love until she has to leave. I really enjoyed the first half of this book. Though I enjoyed the 2nd half, well like I said, i am just not sure what to think. I didn\u2019t hate it. I will selectively read more from this author.",

      "review_text": "This is a story about the power of books and enchanted stories, a mother\u2019s love and finding a safe place. Mia Jacob grew up in a strict cult in Massachusetts, where contact with the outside world is forbidden, punishments for breaking the rules are harsh and books are banned. While she\u2019s selling produce at the farmers market she sneaks off to the library and for Mia it\u2019s her salvation. Here she meets the town\u2019s librarian Sarah, who gives her a library card, it opens up a whole new world to Mia and a risky one. Mia becomes obsessed by one book and it saves her, The Scarlett Letter by the author Nathaniel Hawthorne, it\u2019s about a single woman who has a child in the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony and she is forced to wear the letter \u201cA\u201d for adultery. The story parallels Ivy's, Mia\u2019s mother, she was single and pregnant, ran away from home and lived in Massachusetts.Mia discovers reading can transport you to another time, this is where the magical realism element to the narrative begins, is Mia the young women who falls in love with a character in her favorite book or does she go back in time, meets the writer Nathaniel Hawthorne who lived two hundred years ago and falls in love with him?\u201cA single dream is more powerful than a thousand realities.\u201d This is the story of one woman\u2019s dream and for a little while it came true.I received a copy of The Invisible Hour by Alice Hoffman from Edelweiss and Simon & Schuster in exchange for an honest review. I must admit I\u2019m not a big fan of magical realism or time travel stories and I may not have really grasped the meaning behind Ms. Hoffman's book. What was interesting was reading about the friendship between Mia, and librarians Sarah Mott and her companion Constance Allen. A short story and the first novel I have read by Alice Hoffman, and don't let my review put you off reading her latest book yourself and three and a half stars from stars from me.",

      "review_text": "3.5 StarsThe book tells the tale of a college girl named Ivy who is born into privilege and loves to read. When she falls pregnant by her college boyfriend who won't take responsibility, telling her parents doesn't solve her problem either. Rather than be sent away somewhere to give up the baby, she runs away and finds a home in a cult-like community. Books are forbidden, but when daughter Mia is helping mother Ivy and the community sell fruit opposite the library, Ivy allows her to go there on the ruse of using their bathroom. A lot of us get the \"reading bug\" from our Moms, and I guess Ivy couldn't help herself despite all the brain-washing from the cult. Mia's life is forever transformed when she randomly picks a first edition copy of \"A Scarlet Letter\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne from the library shelf. I was very much enjoying the first two thirds of this book, thinking I was sailing to a 4-Star read when the story veered into a time travel situation at the end. I usually read up to three books at a time depending on my interest, but had a pleasant surprise when I quickly plowed through the first third of this book in short order, not wanting to read anything else. However, with the onset of the time travel aspect, rather than adding a wow factor to the tale it actually cheapened it for me, robbing it of authenticity. I also found myself a tad bored reading passages about nature and even Nathaniel Hawthorne himself. Thank you to Atria Books / Simon & Schuster for providing an advance reader copy via Edelweiss.",

      "review_text": "After reading my first Alice Hoffman book earlier this year, I was hooked... although I first experienced her storytelling capabilities when I fell in love with the movie, Practical Magic. After reading the first two books in that series, I wanted to savor the characters and hold off on the final one, but I also needed to read more Hoffman... that's when I noticed The Invisible Hour appeared on NetGalley, and I was lucky enough to get a copy. Very different (yet remarkably similar) this book focuses on Ivy and her daughter, Mia, who grow up on a commune in Western Massachusetts. All the usual things that happen on communes occur, both bad and good, which prompts Mia to run away after an incident. She's taken in by a kind librarian and her girlfriend, and that's when the book takes a different turn. Mia transports back in time to be with her favorite author, Nathanial Hawthorne, as she felt like the stigma of the scarlet letter symbolized their life on the commune. That's when Hoffman teases readers by showing us that Mia inspired Hawthorne to write the book, and the book is what saved Mia from staying on the commune and being abused.Loved the concept; less magical than other books, as it was just the concept of transporting through time rather than spells and potions. I think I prefer the spells and potions, but adoring Hawthorne's books made me also feel connected to this one. Slightly confusing at times, the plot zigzagged through history to connect several characters and relationships. Ultimately, I view this less as a plot-based contemporary/historical novel and more as a character-based literary novel. Life lessons are taught. Imagery is shared to push readers to think about how and why things happen. Are coincidences always coincidences, or has someone like Fate been pulling strings? A good way to experience Hoffman, but I wouldn't start with this book as your intro. Looking forward to sample more in the future.",

Publishes August 15, 2023.With her fairy tale magic Hoffman has found yet another winner. Suspending your belief for a little time travel in this story will make it even more enjoyable. A young girl born into in a cult, breaks free, wanting to enjoy both the world and books - which are banned in her setting. However, trouble follows her, even into the past, as her love for her favorite author is realized. Told in three parts, Hoffman gives us the present, the past and the possible - as only a good author can do. There is not a lot left to be said about Alice Hoffman. Once you pick up one of her novels, you are hooked. She mixes truth, magical realism, fantasy and the supernatural all to the betterment of women. Complex relationships are her specialty. And she has again hit the mark with this novel.",

      "review_text": "What a stunning beautiful thought provoking book! Alice Hoffman is my favorite go to author and she writes beautifully. This one is written more like a dream. One has to not ask very many logical questions, you sort of have to float through it, and wait for it to tie and weave together. Alice Hoffman knows about a number of things that powerfully show up in her book. She knows about writers, curses, true and those we give the power to. She knows about the power of books and words. She knows about women, those who are trapped in time, and the confines of time, and those who can create possibilities. And she knows about the immense power of mothers and their children, particularly mothers and daughters. This one was different than the others. I like that Alice Hoffman writes in a range of genres and for a range of authors and always tries new things. Some readers get upset when a writer changes their formula or style. Others get upset when your books become formulaic. Alice seems to find a way simply to write and let a new kind of story flow and emerge, each different and yet authentically hers. This one is different, and yet it feels seamlessly a part of her cannon. Spiritual, and powerful, and heart rendering, and quietly magical all at once. Bravo, once again. I can't wait to see what comes next. Still keeping my eyes open for you at the Waban Starbucks. All of your coffee is on me.",

      "review_text": "I had heard so many great things about Alice Hoffman\u2019s works, but didn\u2019t get the chance to read anything by her until now. Hoffman\u2019s newest book, \nThe Invisible Hour\n, is a beautifully written story that covers so much ground theme-wise. It is about a mother\u2019s undying love for her daughter, about the freedom of choice and defying the restrictions that society places on women, about love, heartbreak, self-discovery, found families, and what I loved most of all: the enduring power of books and the myriad ways they can affect those who read them. I\u2019m sure many an avid reader will be able to recall an example of when the right book came into their lives at exactly the right time that resulted in a profound change or impact in some way. In the case of the main protagonist in this story, Mia Jacob, the book is \nThe Scarlet Letter\n by Nathaniel Hawthorne \u2014 a book that not only (literally) saves her life, but also goes beyond that in its ability to provide profound clarity and meaning as the book accompanies her through her journey of self-discovery.Hoffman weaves in time travel and magical realism to great effect here. The first part of the story is set in an undefined \u201chere and now\u201d in Boston, Massachusetts, where Ivy Jacob, a young girl from a wealthy family, finds herself pregnant and alone after her boyfriend abandons her and her parents threaten to send her away as well as put the baby up for adoption. Ivy runs away and ends up on a farm in rural Massachusetts, which turns out to be an oppressive cult called the Community, run by a charismatic but dangerous man named Joel Davis. Ivy marries Joel and gives birth to her daughter, Mia. The Community has strict rules and people who reside there are often subject to harsh punishments for the slightest infraction \u2014 punishments that usually involve public humiliation of some sort, such as having their hair forcefully cut or having a letter branded on their bodies. When Mia commits the cardinal sin of reading books in secret (books are considered evil and are banned in the Community), she finds herself in an untenable situation where she must take matters into her own hands. The second part of the story is set in 1837, in Salem, Massachusetts, and focuses on Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s life in the years prior to him writing the novel that would make home famous. In part three of the story is where both worlds collide in ways that are interesting and unexpected, yet follow a trajectory that is careful about not altering history.This was a book that I couldn\u2019t help being immersed in the entire time I was reading it, even though stories with time travel and magical realism aren\u2019t usually my jam. I think much of this had to do with Hoffman\u2019s exquisite writing and brilliant storytelling, which wove the historical and fantastical elements together in a compelling fashion (though I have to say that I was a bit ambivalent about the ending). When I finished the book, my first thought was to marvel at how Hoffman pulled this story off in a way that felt both magical and historically believable, while also incorporating timely commentary on societal issues. Of course, this was also a wonderful tribute to books and reading. What a great first experience with Hoffman\u2019s works! This definitely got me interested in reading her other books at some point.Oh, also, for those who decide to pick this one up, there\u2019s a moving, gorgeously written Author\u2019s Letter at the beginning of the book that is absolutely not to be missed.

      "review_text": "Alice Hoffman is best known for her notable works of fantasy literature, mostly centered around witches. Witchy elements are included in Hoffman\u2019s latest, The Invisible Hour, but it almost feels as if the novel lacks the elements it needs. With The Invisible Hour, Hoffman takes a different approach. The novel follows Mia, whose mother is Ivy. Ivy grew up with an unloveable childhood. Her parents were even planning to get rid of her. This is all until Ivy hitches a bus ride to a small community in the middle of western Massachusetts. This modern-day community is described as a cult, and it\u2019s blatantly obvious what this community stands for is far from what Ivy actually needs in her life. But, despite this, Ivy joins the cult as a pregnant, single mother and will spend the rest of her life there. She has a daughter. Fifteen-year-old Mia doesn\u2019t enjoy her life in this community. She\u2019s not allowed to read books, paint art, or even wear the clothes she chooses. Mia becomes obsessed with The Scarlet Letter after finding an edition mystery dedicated to her. This book begins her obsession with literature, a thing she\u2019s not allowed to have and love in this community. So, she ends up hiding her book under barrels of hay.Hoffman\u2019s latest is surely a loveable new feature, but the second part of Hoffman\u2019s novel went downhill for me. I enjoyed the little book easter eggs thrown in since the novel takes a lot from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s classic works of literature. The twist, which appeared towards the second half of the book, felt extremely incohesive and unneeded. This twist ended up ruining the whole novel for me, which was disappointing. Yes, the second half was still enjoyable, but it honestly felt like a completely different book. It\u2019s almost as if Hoffman was trying to make this novel fit too many genres.Hoffman creates another enjoyable novel, but the novel\u2019s main twist is rather incohesive and unneeded.",

If I were truly interested in him, I would have chosen a biography, but I chose a work of fiction.I\u2019m going to stop here, just where I stopped reading the book.

Among many strict rules, reading is forbidden, but after a few stealth trips to the local library, books vastly open the world to Mia. When Mia experiences great loss, it pushes her to explore beyond the confines of the community. The Scarlet Letter resonates deeply with her. She can\u2019t believe a story written so long before her existence captures her feelings so well. The Invisible Hour follows Mia as she learns the power of words, pursues her freedom, and experiences love, in multiple forms. The story is told in parts, with shifting POVs. While I preferred the early parts of the book and was more interested in those aspects of the story, I still really enjoyed it overall. I can understand why the sharp shifts in storyline may not work for everyone, and it\u2019s best to accept that in true Hoffman form, there\u2019s some magical realism at play. As an avid reader, I really liked the theme about the power of books and I was rooting for Mia.",

The daughter of Ghanaian immigrants settled in London, Maddie, working a dead-end administrative job is responsible for the care of her father, whose Parkinson's Disease is now at an advanced stage.

As Maddie reflects on her life she shares how she feels that this nickname has somehow defined her, determined how she is perceived by her family members and has influenced not only how she interacts with others but also how she treats herself.\u201cIt made me grow up when I should have had more time. It made my dad overlook me when I was a child, my mum leave me behind, and my brother get away with doing the bare minimum. It made me lonely and it made me sad. It made me responsible and guilty. It made me someone, if given the choice, I wouldn\u2019t want to be.\u201dBoth inter and intra-role conflict are excellently depicted in Maddie\u2019s story. The author gives us a picture of how culture influences roles and expectations within families and relationships. In Maddie, struggling to find a balance between the Ghanaian family values instilled in her since childhood and her life and aspirations as a Londoner, we find an endearing protagonist who is sweet, smart and lovable and is doing her level best to find her way in the world. Her struggles are real and relatable and her pain and grief are palpable. I found the author's writing on Maddie\u2019s struggles with grief and the discussion on mental health particularly powerful and moving. Maddie\u2019s first-person PoV reels you in and makes you feel like a confidante with whom she is sharing her experiences. I felt invested in her story, grieving with her, feeling her anger ,guilt and pain and celebrating her moments of triumph. Heartbreaking in parts, and hopeful in others, the author tells a beautiful story of love, family, friendships, personal growth and self-acceptance with wit, wisdom and emotional depth. It is hard to believe that this is the author\u2019s debut novel. I look forward to reading more from this talented author in the future.Many thanks to St. Martin\u2019s Press and NetGalley for the digital review copy of this beautifully-penned novel. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. \u201c 'Many assume love is straightforward,\u201d Angelina continues, \u201cwhen really it is the most complicated of things. There is a right way, a preferred way, for each individual, to love and be loved by someone\u2014but there isn\u2019t only one way. I believe the difficulty of life has much to do with understanding and then navigating how the people you love both express and receive love themselves. It cannot be your responsibility, your burden, to reshape people into someone you\u2019d like them to be. Ultimately, you must either accept a person for who they are, how they behave, how they express themselves emotionally, and find a healthy way to live with them, or let them go entirely. Either way, you must release yourself from that responsibility.\u2019 \u201d",

      "review_text": "One of my favorite fictions of the year that you should consider to vote at Goodreads Choice Awards 2023! Maame is extremely fresh, engaging, powerful novel! It\u2019s about family, grief, self growth, guilt, regrets, starting over! It\u2019s inspirational, memorable, unique, playing a marvelous melody with the strings of your heart, embracing your soul, presenting a different approach! Maddie Wright is not happy to grow up early, carrying extra responsibilities of life! At the age of 25, most of her friends left the city for going to the college, flirting, partying, going out, sharing a loft with room mates, exploring the life, traveling around the world.  For last 8 years Maddie\u2019s life completely changed after finding out her father\u2019s Parkinson diagnosis. Her mother kept leaving the country to help her brother in Ghana to take care of family business for at least one year and coming back later as her brother kept spending time with his friends\u2019 family for years. And now her father\u2019s health condition gets deteriorated as her brother keeps making excuses not to visit his family home and her mother keeps insisting she\u2019s so busy in Ghana unless she calls for borrowing money from Maddie\u2019s saving account!  She is the only one who takes care of her father, getting trapped in PA job at theater company, dealing with the mood swings of her boss.  Her mother calls her Maame which is a word in Twi language with different meanings. But most common meaning is woman and Maddie resents her nickname because she doesn\u2019t live her life as a naive, inexperienced young girl and directly grew up to be a woman.  But now she has an opportunity to take a break from her all responsibilities and do things like other 25 years old young woman do! Her mother flies back from Ghana and advises her to move another apartment to live her independent life. For the first her mother will be the one who will take care of her own husband! This means Maddie can start from fresh. She already made her list.Here\u2019s the new Maddie\u2019s independence manifesto: -Drink alcohol when offered-Always say yes to social events-Wear new clothes-Cook new food-Have different experiences (Travel? Brunch?)-Try weed or cigarettes at least once (but don't get addicted!)-Wear makeup-Go on dates-Lose your virginity.Challenge accepted! Maddie is ready to shine! But you know what they say: you make plans and God laughs! There\u2019s a new and more challenging chapter is about to open in Maddie\u2019s life. Will she get through new challenges life throws at her?This is incredible, thought provoking work with genuine and realistic approach to the grief, dysfunctional family relationships, becoming minority at the work place, exploring sexuality, romantic involvements, your capabilities and your unfinished search for happiness.During my reading I felt for Maddie! I gritted my teeth when I witness her communication with her family members and some of her friends. I felt sad for her but I also respected her!Overall: this well written, perfectly developed book definitely deserves five stars or more!I loved Maddie\u2019s compelling journey!Many thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin\u2019s Press for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.",

Her Mom lives in Ghana and she is running a hostel. Maddie is twenty five years old and lives in London. Her brother does not help her at all with the care of her father. Maddie's Mom visits her every other year and is always criticizing her. I really loved this book. There are likable characters and unlikable characters. The characters are very well done. I also loved the writing style. My favorite character is Maddie. She never cares about herself but always takes care of others. She loves pleasing people. She goes to the University and is the only black woman in her classes. Her mother calls her Maame which has many different meanings in Twi, mainly meaning Woman. Maddie did not have a childhood. I did not like her Mom at all. She was always criticizing Maddie. I also did not like her brother who always thought of himself. This was an emotional read for me. It had all of the emotions. I love a book that makes me feel. It also is uplifting and I loved the great messages in this bookI want to thank Netgalley, and St. Martin's Press for the copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",

      "review_text": "Every now and then a book comes along that makes you cancel all your plans and spend the entire time enveloped in the pages of the book- never wanting to leave- Maame is such book! Engrossing, engaging, beautifully written with a main character you would go to war for. Let me start with saying MAAME is one of my favorite books for 2023 and it is just February- but I am calling it. This is a must read. In  Maame  we meet Maddie, in her twenties and should be living her best London life but with everyone of her family member shirking their duties she ends up being the primary caretaker for her father who suffers from Parkinson\u2019s. Her mother spends half the year in London and the other half in Ghana but makes sure to ask for money and send strongly worded text telling Maddie how to live her life. Maddie\u2019s older brother left the family home a long time to live and travel with his friends. He checks in, but his life mostly involves his friends who he\u2019s made his family. Maddie must take care of her family, go to work at a very unrewarding job where her boss is unreasonable, unstable and chaotic- all while being the only Black person present. It is exhausting. Finally Maddie\u2019s mother returns to London to take over as lead caregiver for her husband and Maddie can now step into the role of young twenty-something-finding herself! She moves out, starts making friends, dating, speaking up for herself, and making a list of what the New Maddie will look like. Maddie is way out of her comfort zone but intends to lean into the life she couldn\u2019t live previously. All seems to be going great until it is not and Maddie\u2019s world comes crumbling\u2026 fast. Let me tell you something\u2026 I inhaled this book. Well written, funny, moving, this book will have you fighting for a fictional character. Jessica George did the damn thing with this book. I can see this being the book of 2023 because the character is so relatable. The book touches on a number of topics dating, family, grief, friendship, religion, microaggression at work, family expectation, racism, capitalism, all while being relevant and not trying too hard. Maame does brilliantly what Such A Fun Age was trying to do. I will say, if you enjoyed Queenie, you will definitely love reading about Maddie. Very complex characters who are going through things you may have experience. I will say the ending felt rushed and there were some google searches that could have been left out but overall a very stunning debut.

      "review_text": "**Many thanks to NetGalley, St. Martin's Press, and Jessica George for an ARC of this book! Now available as of 1.31!!**\n\"Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves.\"-Henry David Thoreau\nIn the English-Twi dictionary, \"maame\" means mother, and can also mean to bring \"to bring up a child with love and care.\" And although Maddie has had this nickname for many years, the role of caretaker isn't necessarily one she feels born to fulfill...but she does so anyway. Maddie's father has late stage Parkinson's, and with her mother traipsing back and forth between London and Ghana (where mom runs a hostel), Maddie has been the steadfast, reliable daughter who puts her own aspirations on the back burner more often than not to be the rock her father needs to get from day to day.When Maddie's mother finally decides to return for more than a fleeting moment and put down some sort of roots, it feels like a sign, and Maddie is ready to break free. Free of what, though, she isn't sure. She starts with embarking on a new career and moves into her own place with two roommates. But grappling with a new career as an admin at a publishing company isn't quite the drastic switch she was hoping for...and when romance taps her on the shoulder, Maddie isn't exactly sure she's ready for that either. And when a tragic situation shakes up Maddie's world for good, she begins to question EVERY choice she's made in this new life. Will Maddie's 'failure to launch', coupled with the timing of this tragic incident, keep her mired in depression and paralyzed by fear? Or can this instead become the true watershed moment she has been so desperately seeking?I'll admit that I knew very little about this book going in and wasn't exactly sold by the cover, but I have to say by about 10%, I KNEW this was going to be on my 2023 favorites list. George's writing is smooth and effortless, and with the way this book is narrated, I felt like I truly UNDERSTOOD Maddie as a character almost immediately. Her style of first person narration is simultaneously charming and conflicted, and I was invested in her journey immediately. I think part of the reason I grew to care for Maddie so quickly was that I saw so much of my younger (and to some extent, current) self in her and above all, I just wanted to see her THRIVE!Though somewhat misguided and a bit too reliant on Google, Maddie has a pure and loving heart and a selfless nature, and it's no wonder that even in her mid-20s she is struggling to find her voice and her place in the world. So much of her past is heartbreaking, her relationship with her family members is as twisted and convoluted as most, and yet...even in the wake of her worst decisions, I just wanted to reach out and reassure her that the answers DO come...at least, for the most part.People often say to \"be the person you needed when you were younger\"...but in terms of this book, this felt like the READ I needed when I was younger, but I am still so grateful to get it now. George has just the right balance of silly moments and humor (at times Maddie's inner dialogue and angel on her shoulder reminded me of Zach Braff a la Scrubs and his 'daydreams', which was always delightful) and yet, she handles heavy topics like depression and finding personal fulfillment, what it means to be family and what you can (or can't) expect from those you love, and the joy AND pain that can come from navigating through your first real relationship in equal measure. This is bildungsroman the way it was meant to be written: moving, impactful, thoughtful, emotional, and as ever-evolving as life itself. A truly effortless and beautiful debut!4.5 stars\nNominated for Best Fiction and Best Debut in the Goodreads Choice Awards! Also available now in paperback!",

      "review_text": "An incredible debut from Jessica George with an all too authentic central protagonist in the irresistible twenty something Maddie Wright that you will not be able to stop yourself rooting for. This is vibrant and witty storytelling, of the complexities of families, race, culture, being a woman, growing up, self development with all its joys and pain, and becoming secure in your identity. Maame is what her so often absent mother called her from when she was little, it has numerous meanings in Twi but commonly it means woman. In practice, this has meant Maddie has been over burdened by family responsibilities when she should have been experiencing a childhood, resulting in her missing out on so much in life, and in everything that others of her age take for granted, whilst employment for her is far from a happy affair. Maddie's overbearing mother spends a lot of time in Ghana managing a hostel, and her brother has been of little help, as she takes her care of her father, suffering from advanced stage Parkinson's. Upon the return of her mother, Maddie takes the opportunity to leave home and finally begin to start living life, moving into a flat share, keen to experience all that she can, both at work and in her personal life. A naive and lacking in self esteem Maddie finds herself going through life's natural ups and downs, including betrayal, until she is hit by a tragedy that immerses her into a world of guilt as she hits rock bottom. The narrative has Maddie examining how being 'Maame' has shaped expectations of her, of being a 'woman' before her time, of how her family see her and her relationships, and perhaps more importantly how she has let it mould her own sense of identity. It is time for things to change and for Maddie to be who and what she wants to be.This is a wonderfully captivating, moving, at times heartbreaking, humorous and an emotional read, of all that life can be, the struggles and the joy, of love, loss and grief, race, of family, cultural and gender expectations, a late coming of age story, and learning to find and be true to yourself in a world that does not always make this an easy process. The highlight for me throughout is the character of Maddie, she shines as she faces the challenges that life throws at her, on her journey to acknowledging, accepting and becoming confident in who she is, in all her glorious differences. Highly recommended. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.",

      "review_text": "In a Nutshell: An interesting debut work focussing on the titular \u2018Maame\u2019, who is caught between her duty and her life. As an OwnVoices coming-of-age work, the novel delivers to a great extent on its promise, though it did have certain flaws.Story Synopsis:Maddie, a British-Ghanaian girl in her mid-twenties, is the \u2018Maame\u2019 of her family, Maame meaning \u2018woman\u2019 in their native Twi. With an absent mum and an irresponsible elder brother, Maddie is the one taking care of her ailing father as well as their financial requirements. She barely has any personal life beyond this. When her mum promises to return from Ghana, Maddie finally decides to take charge of her own life and do everything she couldn\u2019t or hadn\u2019t. Will it really be as easy as that? The story comes to us in the first person perspective of Maddie.Unlike my usual headings of what I liked and what I disliked, I will have only one category this time, because the entire book left me with mixed feelings. The only exception was the title, for which I have only positive feelings. Not only does it serve as an interesting first point of appeal, but it is also justified in almost every chapter. Mixed feelings all the way:\u26a0 This is the first book I have read with a Ghanaian character (and by an author of Ghanaian origin.) I liked the insight the author showed us into the beliefs and behaviour of the Ghanaian people. She also depicts the struggles of second-generation immigrants nicely. At the same time, there is hardly anything positive about Ghanaian culture. The first-gen people are depicted as selfish pests. \u26a0 Maddie is overly dependent on Google for even tiny things, and these online searches add a lot of fun to the plot. This could go either way, of course. Some of her online queries are ridiculous. But I found it hilarious how she googled even the stupidest of things and took the advice seriously. On a related note, Maddie\u2019s first-person inner rambling also has some good bits of humour.\u26a0 Maddie does justice to the title role. She is not portrayed as the perfect girl. She is dutiful, loyal, and intelligent, but she is also easy to push over, gullible, and impulsive. This realistic portrayal appealed to me. At the same time, I felt like she was too na\u00efve and closeted to be believable. She was a 25-year-old Londoner for goodness\u2019 sake! How could she not be aware of certain basics, especially considering her reliance on Google? Her blatant lies and her judgemental behaviour, especially in the second half, didn\u2019t endear her to me. Also, her transformation from homebody to a free bird living on her own terms is too instant to be convincing. \u26a0 As is common with many debut authors\u2019 works, Maame too includes a whole range of themes within its plot: death of a family member, grief, corporate/professional conflicts, peer pressure, mental health issues, familial troubles, micro-aggressions, racism, sexual identity crises, romantic problems, Parkinson\u2019s and the sadness it brings, extra-marital affairs, online dating,\u2026 Many of these were relevant and well-written, but some of the issues felt shoehorned. A few of the scenes felt like they were added only for the potential for social commentary though they had no direct impact on Maddie\u2019s life.\u26a0 Other than Maddie, none of her family members are written as likeable. One scene with Maddie\u2019s roommate felt really silly and out of character. Her work colleagues are idiotic most of the times, and her friends, while having great roles, come in the main scenes just a few times. As such, if you like Maddie, you will like the book. But if you find her irritating, you might hate the content because there is no other character to fall back upon. \u26a0 The writing is a too simplistic. This work has been marked as \u2018New Adult\u2019 (which is nothing but YA with Sex Scenes IMHO) by the publishers, and the book does fit the NA genre well. But I wish the writing had been more nuanced. \u26a0 The book tries to be gender-inclusive with the presence of lesbian and bi characters. However, a certain subplot is highly biphobic.The audiobook experience:The audiobook, clocking at a little over 10 hours, is narrated by Heather Agyepong. She does a fabulous job of voicing Maddie and her insecurities as well as newfound confidence. If you are an avid audiobook listener, you will certainly enjoy her nuanced narration. If you are an audiobook newbie, this would be a good book to begin your audio journey with as there are no multiple timelines or varying perspectives to confuse you. The narration is easy-going on the ears.When I looked at the author\u2019s profile, I realised that she has quite a few things in common with Maddie. So is this partially autobiographical? I would have preferred an author\u2019s note about this aspect. (It is quite possible that such a note exists in the digital/paper copies, but my audio version didn\u2019t have it.)All in all, this book has appeal as the coming-of-age story from a British-Ghanaian perspective. It has plenty of emotions, good and bad and ugly. The main character is what will make or break the book for you, so if you do pick it up, I hope you like her so that you can connect better with the book.3.5 stars, rounding up for the excellent narration in the audio version.My thanks to Hodder & Stoughton Audio and NetGalley for the ALC of \u201cMaame\u201d.

      "review_text": "Lisa\u2019s Life Lessons for Maddie:1.\tWhen you need to terminate a relationship (aka break up with someone), make a PowerPoint presentation. This serves two purposes: 1) the receiver will have an opportunity to learn how to become a better human being and 2) when you are lonely in 2 weeks, 2 months, or 2 years, nostalgic for a relationship that wasn\u2019t \u201cthat bad\u201d, you can open up your PowerPoint and remember in crystal clear clarity why you dumped that loser.2.\tMake informed choices. Before jumping in the sack with someone, ask for STI testing. If you are old enough to participate in adult activities, you should be responsible. Do you want a life-long virus for someone who you went only went on 3 dates with? If the person really does care about you, they shouldn't have a problem getting tested.3.\tWhen a tragedy strikes a co-worker, that person will always remember how they were treated. A co-worker of mine had a stillborn child. A corporate wide email went out specifically telling us not to talk about it because she didn\u2019t want to talk about what happened 300 times. As a people leader (fancy word for boss), I know that some people want to dive right back into work and want a distraction. Other people will need to go slowly. This is where I would have a private discussion with my employee telling them exactly that, that I have his or her back no matter what and to tell me what they need and to let me know if they change their mind. 4.\tGetting credit at work. No one likes working with an arrogant person. And there is a big difference between school and work. At work, there is a team. When my team prepares a tax return, it doesn\u2019t matter if I worked on it 90%, the associate 5%, the partner 5%. We win and lose as a team. I would never put in an email, \u201cHere is the tax return where I did most of the work.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t go over well, and it would decimate team morale. Instead, Maddie needs to schedule 30 minutes with her boss each week. Go to that meeting each week with a list of questions and talking points (establish expectations like the milk, discuss career growth, wanting to be in Creative meetings, talk about the value that you are bringing like the book ideas, ask about the history of the company, challenges that you can\u2019t resolve, get comfortable talking to your boss). In my experience, the hardest workers don\u2019t get promoted. They silently work off in the corner, get frustrated, and find a job elsewhere. Someone who has a working relationship with their boss is much more likely to get promoted. When sweet, urgent, high-value projects come through the door, you want your boss to have you top of mind. That is less likely to happen if you are silently working away in the corner. Don\u2019t wait for someone else to schedule that meeting. Set it up. 5.\tBoundaries. You need some with your mother and others. If you are uncomfortable, speak up! If you need help, call a friend.6.\tCome to meetings prepared. Once upon a time, I worked for a major global company, and the motto was, \u201cBe prepared to make a decision in the room.\u201d Before the meeting, anticipate what will be asked and what will be discussed. For example, if you are going to discuss how to spend advertising dollars, you should research what your competitors are doing, perhaps research what is going on with X, formerly known as Twitter, because it seems that lots of advertisers have left the platform, research other alternate advertising platforms. When you go into the meeting, you will have data already at your fingertips so you can make a meaningful contribution. It also saves a lot of time because people don\u2019t have to wait for you to go back to your desk, research a million things, and then get back to them. Especially in today\u2019s business landscape, decisions need to be made quickly.7.\tTalk therapy isn\u2019t for everyone. In my experience, support groups have been really helpful. When I was around Maddie\u2019s age, I hit a major spot of depression and started attending a weekly support group, \u201cCoping With Depression\u201d at Michigan State\u2019s campus. When I listened to the others, I realized that they were crazy, but I knew that I thought some of those exact same crazy things. For example, a lot of people believed that no one wanted to be their friend. I knew that was a lie because I wanted to be their friend. I knew it wasn\u2019t true. But where were these feelings coming from? Usually, it was loneliness, sadness, or disappointment, and these are absolutely normal emotions. So when the thought, \u201cNobody cares if I live or die!\u201d came into my head, I would try to trace back where that came from. Usually, I was lonely or disappointed, and I gave myself permission to be lonely or disappointed, maybe call someone sympathetic to talk through that feeling, and most of the time the feeling passed very quickly when I wasn\u2019t repressing my feelings. Identifying with others, finding understanding and connection helps.8.\tBe kind to yourself. Learn to be a friend to yourself. No one can be perfect, and if you wouldn\u2019t hold a friend to those impossibly high standards, you should cut yourself some slack. It is OK to disappoint people by communicating your needs. I\u2019m still working on this one myself. It seems to be a life-long process.How much I spent:Electronic text \u2013 Free through LibbyAudiobook \u2013 Free through LibbyConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta",

      "review_text": "Maame means woman in Twi. It\u2019s also the name that Maddie\u2019s mother has called her from an early age.The book was described as humorous. Well, heads up. There\u2019s nothing humorous about the first section of the book. Maddie\u2019s life is depressing - she cares for a father with advanced Parkinson\u2019s, her mother is in Ghana but still is overbearing, her boss is a cruel idiot. I couldn\u2019t figure out why Maddie lies. She tells no one, not even her close friend, how poorly her father is doing. When she hurts her back lifting her father, she even lies to the doctor. But later in the book, even she realizes why she\u2019s doing it and it makes so much sense.  In many ways, she\u2019s very innocent and young for her age. Oh, I wanted to just take her aside and explain things to her. Although, as one of her friends states, some things you just have to go through yourself. As the book progresses, she starts to find her voice and speak up for herself. As one responsible daughter watching another, I was definitely rooting for her. The book is partially written as if Maddie is speaking directly to the reader. \u201cYou\u2019ve now met my mother, so are at least partway to understanding why I can\u2019t tell her\u2026\u201d Other times, it\u2019s just a straight first person narrative. Maddie has an unhealthy reliance on using Google for everything and we are subjected to her searches. Some of the instances were humorous but I also felt like George was trying to make a point but she was hitting me over the head to make sure I got it. Overall, this was a lovely debut novel with a fully realized main character. It tackles some difficult themes (grief, racism, depression, parental absence) with insight, strength and compassion. I loved the ending. My thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin\u2019s Press for an advance copy of this book.Update - Jenna Bush just picked this for her February book club. Great selection!",

She is still living in her parents\u2019 home in London since she is caring for her father who has Parkinson\u2019s disease.Although Maddie has gone to University, she was a commuter and didn\u2019t really get that \u201ccollege life experience\u201d, always having to go to work or come home to care for her dad.She is tired of being the only Black person where she works and knows that she is working at a job that she is over qualified for, it doesn\u2019t help that her boss doesn\u2019t appreciate or listen to Maddie\u2019s suggestions.

      "review_text": "Now AvailableMaame is a debut novel by Jessica George. It is a bildungsroman story of 25-year-old Maddie Wright, born and raised in London to Ghanaian parents and studied English Literature in college. After she is unfairly fired from a job at a theater, she lands a job in the editorial department of a small publishing company. It is interesting to note that the author, Jessica George, was born and raised in London to Ghanaian parents and studied English Literature. After working at a literary agency and a theatre, she landed a job in the editorial department of Bloomsbury UK. This makes me wonder how much of the story is autobiographical. Maame has many meanings in Twi, the native language of Maddie's parents. But in Maddie's case, it means \"woman.\" When her mother called her that as a young girl, Maddie was flattered. But at 25, after many years of parental neglect, Maddie hates how the name made her grow up when she was too young. When her mother regularly leaves London and goes to Ghana for a year or more at a time, Maddie is left to care for her sick father. She gives up her social life in order to be one of his caregivers. Her parents forbid her from talking about their odd family situation, so Maddie can never reveal her true self to her friends. She is lonely and depressed. All she wants is to be less sad. Her mother encourages her to move out of the family home upon her latest return from Ghana. But soon after Maddie leaves, the unimaginable happens to her father, and guilt and grief come bearing down. She starts out as a very naive young woman, trying to navigate family, career, dating, and the freedom to be an adult. Maddie's pain is palatable and believable. She lacks confidence and tries very hard to be a people pleaser. She struggles with grief and panic attacks. She makes unwise dating decisions. Through the help of counseling and her own self-determination, Maddie learns to become the type of \"maame\" she is meant to be. The first part of the novel was a little slow for me, but by the end, I was fully invested in Maddie's character. 4-plus stars.",

      "review_text": "1.5 starsSadly, this book is going into the \"not for me in '23\", pile, as I found it juvenile and so unbelievable.The main protagonist is twenty-five and supposedly lived in a convent tucked away in the Himalayas. (just kidding). However, she is ott naive, has an absentee mother who rules the roost even though she is never present, a sick father, an unfeeling brother, zero friends, and lives at home.I don't really know how she got this far is life but then we find out when in doubt ask google, such questions as should I have sex on a third date, (yes, she finally snags a boyfriend). The questions to google are not only stupid but also annoying. I realize this woman was a neophyte in the world but honestly had she never watched TV, gone to a movie, overheard people talk, or even attended a biology class? (although she attended college and graduated with an English Lit degree, she must have fallen asleep during classes). She works in a dead end job and then gets fired. Oh the woes keep on coming for Maddie!The transformation of Maddie in the second half of the book happens somewhat instantaneously as she moves out of her family home after tragedy happens, bares a bushel full of guilt, becomes a hot number, experiences racism, and so on. In other words the author followed the \"kitchen sink\" motif in the story.I did see potential in the story, and since it has garnered so many 4-5 star reviews, I persisted in listening to this one. All I can say, is perhaps I read a different rendering of this book. So sad to say, I did finish but with a rousing \"what the heck\" was that?Thank you to NetGalley for an opportunity to listen to this story. (Outlier Island is pretty lonely this go round)",

      "review_text": "3.5 starsI chose the wrong format for Maame.I went with the audiobook, and while I can say with great sincerity that Heather Agyepong did a fine job narrating Jessica George\u2019s debut novel, for me, something was missing. Something got lost in the audio translation.Maddie, called Maame by her Ghanian mother, is a twenty-something Black woman still living in her family home in London in order to care for her ailing father. Her mother is in Ghana, her brother is wrapped up in his own life, and her job is not ideal. Maddie needs a change \u2013 and fast. When her mother returns to London, Maddie is thrilled to finally move out on her own and begin her life. Which means checking off items on her to-do list, like renting an apartment, socializing with friends, dating, and focusing on her career. But then tragedy strikes, and Maddie\u2019s new life comes crashing down around her, forcing her to re-evaluate not only her family and friends, but herself, too.So what is it about Maame that got lost in the audio translation? The emotion of the story.As a lead character, Maddie is quite endearing. Her story is the classic coming-of-age tale, where a young woman matures and discovers who she is and what life she wants to lead. (Google helps her a lot with this, by the way.) She\u2019s kind, hard-working, and sensible, which makes it difficult not to care for her.But I didn\u2019t feel much when I listened to her story. I wanted to; I really did. The emotion just never came, and I didn\u2019t feel invested in her life.Others have loved Maame, though, so please don\u2019t hesitate to pick it up. Only read it, don\u2019t listen to it. It\u2019ll be the difference between a three- and a four-star read, I think.",

      "review_text": "Family can be messy. Maddie is the primary care giver for her father who has Parkinson\u2019s, while her mother resides most of the time in Ghana. Her brother, James resides locally but is not very involved. Maddie also has a job but finds it to be unfulfilling. Her mother is overbearing to say the least. She wants Maddie to date and get married. She also cites bible verses and always seems to know what is best for her daughter, even though she has been absent for a huge portion of her life.Maddie is a people pleaser and does not put herself first. She is mature beyond her years in many ways, and not mature at all in others. When her mother comes back to London, Maddie moves into a flat and experiences living with roommate. Maddie makes a list of things the new Maddie should do and embraces them. Along the way, she has many new experiences - some good; some bad. When Maddie and her family are dealing with horrible news, Maddie must face some \"truths\" and begins to grow in many aspects of her life. Maddie was an interesting character, and I wanted many times to tell her to stand up for herself and be strong. To make her voice known and put her foot down. I felt her brother and mother were constantly asking too much from her yet never really took the time to get to know her. I enjoyed and cheered for her as Maddie began to grow and find her voice and footing.This was a coming-of-age story that looks at culture, family, friendship, responsibility, loyalty, love, and growth. There is also the aspect of the power of a name. Our names are huge part of our identity. Maddie is called Maame from an early age. A name that means woman. She felt the responsibility and power of that name all her life. I found this to be a very interesting part of the story.I enjoyed the second half of the book more than the first part, mainly because I was happy to see change occurring. *Buddy read with Traveling Friends/sistersThank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

      "review_text": "This book was a mixed bag for me. The most compelling parts involved how Maddie navigated both grief and her mother's abandonment, having to grow up too soon and care for her ailing father alone. These sections were deeply felt, expressed, and lived-in. George's choice for the title, Maame, illustrates this, as Maddie's feelings about what the nickname meant to her and how that changed over time paralleled her journey and growth throughout the book. George understands family--how you can love someone completely yet hold deep reserves of anger for the choices they made. In the end, Maddie showed both grace and compassion for her imperfect parents whom, like many of us, she didn't see fully as their own people with lives and secrets until tragedy allowed her to confront them. Where the book faltered for me was its depictions of Maddie outside her family home, mainly her love life. These parts seemed much more juvenile--how quickly the virginal Maddie had men fall head-over-heels gaga for her. All of her dates and conversations with men seemed a little too perfect and scripted, even if the relationships did not end in a fairy tale match. George's device of having Maddie constantly Google things--some things no twenty five year-old should rely on a search engine for (\"Can I date my flatmate's ex-boyfriend?\"), made the book seem more like YA than adult fiction. I also wonder why, in at least three instances, George has Maddie refer to the reader, as if she was consciously writing a book of her story. SPOILER ALERT- At the end, we DO discover Maddie is writing a book about her father, but it's not implied that the book we're reading is THE book, as the scope of the story then presumably wouldn't involve Maddie's roommates, love life, work life, etc.There's certainly some good here, but the book was just okay for me.",

      "review_text": "5 incredible debut stars!A beautifully written blend of quirky, funny, sad and serious. This novel follows Maddie, a young woman caring for her aging father who has Parkinson\u2019s disease. Maddie\u2019s mother spends most of her time in Ghana running the family business depending on Maddie to stay in London to run the household in her absence. Maddie struggles to find her sense of self while carrying the weight of her family household, facing the pressure of her mothers overbearing personality from afar, and overcoming workplace challenges. I adored Maddie. She is an incredible character who will stay with me long after finishing this book. I felt for her, rooted for her, cried for her, longed for her to see her worth and gain confidence. I loved following her journey of self discovery. I enjoyed how this novel was a narrative of her inner thoughts, giving the reader full disclosure of her social awkwardness and tendency to over analyze every situation. Several heavy themes are explored through the lighter lens of a quirky, endearing, loveable main character.Through this story, I deeply felt the heaviness of the expectations placed on Maddie by her mother which was heartbreaking. The expectations were a mixture of Ghanaian culture along with the strong pushy personality of her mother. Branching out from her family in her late 20\u2019s, Maddie has a lot of growing and learning to do in order to figure out who she really is and what she wants out of life. After caring for her father for so many years, she lost (or never really found) her voice and sense of identity. Maddie faces various challenges and passes several life milestones throughout this novel \u2014 moving out, depression, racism, dating, financial burden, roommate struggles, death of a loved one, etc. These challenges were well explored, making me feel a strong investment in each aspect of Maddie\u2019s life. This was a fantastic, unique, memorable book that easily earned a spot on my 2023 Favourites Shelf!",

Her internal dialogue shows a mature young woman who is wise beyond her years in so many ways and immature for her age in so many others. She is also unabashedly human and oh-so-funny. She has two good friends who have her back and are wonderful side characters. I loved how fierce they were and how they helped and stood up for Maddie.This is impeccable storytelling, in every sense of the word, with themes of family dynamics, sexuality, race, feminism, and growing as a person as well as up. I hated Maddie's mom, and on a smaller scale her brother, with a passion. Her mother was absent, condescending, and just plain rude. Although she has her reasons, to me they just weren't good enough and came across as excuses.I enjoyed so much about this wonderfully written, heartfelt, and captivating story. I really loved being on Maddie's journey. What a wonderful debut. I can't wait to see what Ms. George comes up with next!Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.#NetGalley",

      "review_text": "\u2019Maame (ma-meh) has many meanings in Twi but in my case, it means woman.\u2019\nThis would be an impressive novel from a seasoned author, but knowing this is a debut novel is astounding. This story pulled me in from the first pages. The way that it is shared feels as though a friend you thought you knew begins to reveal themselves for the first time, releasing all those heartbreaking moments, the ones they felt they had to keep inside. \u2018Maame\u2019 is the nickname her mother has called her since she was a child, a word in Twi language meaning many things, but the most common meaning is woman, which applies since her mother leaves her in charge of most of the adult duties of caring for the house and her father, and is taught to keep their family issues private. Her real name is Madeline, or Maddie. She grew up resenting her nickname because she feels as though she never had a chance to live her life as the young girl that she was, but has always been expected to behave as a woman. Taking on the housework, and now caring for her father who has Parkinson\u2019s Disease, as this story begins. Her mother is back in Ghana, which is where she spends the majority of her time, managing the hostel that she inherited from her father. As for her brother, well\u2026 he shows up now and then, but isn\u2019t exactly reliable. There is a man who comes in to help, but Maddie is a young woman living a life that has been burdened with so many responsibilities, and yet never even been on a date or had a real relationship. When her mother returns, she takes advantage of her return, and moves out of her family home and into a flat shares with other young women around her age.  As this story begins to share other aspects of her life - her job, her friends as well as the new friends she makes, it shows how the years have left her without any real belief in herself, and her lack of experience in the world outside the family walls. She\u2019s vulnerable, and at times others take advantage of that vulnerability. Lessons she is determined not to repeat. This is sweetly humorous at times, poignant at times, and explores so many facets of life. Death, friendship, racism, familial love as well as romantic love, and the pitfalls that can come with dating are part of this story, but at its heart it is a story of family, finding yourself, and love in all its many forms. There\u2019s an element of quirkiness in Maddie as this begins that was a tiny bit reminiscent of Eleanor Oliphant, to me. Maddie\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t seem to quite fit in anywhere, at first, but seems to find confidence as she navigates her new world, the one outside of her family, and sees that she is not the only one who is happy to be different, to be herself, and embrace that. To quote Glinda, \u201dYou had the power all along, my dear\" Pub Date: 31 Jan 2023Many thanks for the ARC provided by St. Martin\u2019s Press!",

      "review_text": "Maame has several meanings in Twi but when applied to Maddie it means woman and oh boy, does she have to grow up quickly. She becomes the primary carer for her father who suffers from Parkinson\u2019s Disease while her mother spends most of her time working in Ghana. Even from a distance her mother rules the roost and is an expert in the art of manipulation and less tour and more force. When her mother returns home for a while Maddie takes the opportunity to move out and start living the more normal life of someone in their 20s. When tragedy strikes it forces Maddie to reassess a multitude of issues.What a beautiful read this is, Maddie captivates me from the start and I become fully immersed and engaged in her life as she faces all her ups and downs. It\u2019s sad at times and at others it\u2019s poignant, sweet, tender and very moving especially the relationship between Maddie and her father which is written with such empathy and love. You want to yell at her mother and brother whose selfish use of Maddie makes you so angry. Maddie is such an endearing character, she\u2019s bright, somewhat of an innocent and a bit naive but she\u2019s very caring while keeps her emotions in check until she doesn\u2019t. Then I\u2019m cheering her on from the sidelines loving her telling certain characters exactly how it is! She makes me laugh too, I love her Google questions and who doesn\u2019t have conversations with themselves? I love both the old and the new Maddie. This is a book that takes you on a journey, that of an an an awakening and a voyage of self discovery. It sounds includes some difficult topics but does so really well and with sensitivity. I love the ending, in fact, scrap that, I love the whole book. It\u2019s feels fresh, different and is a wonderfully written debut novel. Highly recommended. With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Hodder and Stoughton for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.",

      "review_text": "Incredible Moving Story about Maddie, a 25 year old who takes on so much responsibility at such a young age. It has got in the way of her developing her own life and having confidence in the person she is. Her father has Advanced Stage Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Maddie really is the only one in their family to care for her dad. It takes from her, but shows her wonderful and beautiful heart. When Maddie\u2019s mother comes home from Ghana, she is finally able to start finding out who she really is about. She has deep religious, cultural, and family values instilled in her that often compete with her desires to be a young and care free Londoner. Maggie decides to try though and I routed for her the whole time. She\u2019s new to work, living with flat mates, and dating. It is not always easy to find the balance she seeks and it costs her heavily at points that just hurt my heart, but there are also great rewards to be found in relationships both old and new.Maddie is a sweet, intelligent, thoughtful woman who at times is really struggling. Yet, it is possible to be honest and speak about herself as she really is feeling and still find the love she needs. It is both refreshing and heartbreaking for sure, and she endures many ups and downs along the way, but ultimately it is the way for her to find out who the real Maddie is. Fantastic debut novel by Jessica George. I highly recommend this book. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96Thank you NetGalley and St. Martin\u2019s Press for allowing me to read this beautiful story. I am always happy to give my honest feelings about a book.",

Maddie had a lot of ups and downs, and I experienced all the emotions while reading this one.

      "review_text": "I adored this heartfelt, well-developed story about a twenty-something, navigating her own Ghanian culture and a British culture. Under unusual circumstances, she's grown up quickly, taking care of more than a young girl should. Without time to socialize, and understand herself, she\u2019s uncertain the cultures will mesh.\nEveryone talks about the importance of standing out, but never the benefits of fitting in\nShe has a lot on her shoulders. She is single-handedly taking care of her father with late stage Parkisons while her mother is in Ghana \"working.\"\nWe grow up fast. Not by force, but because we are needed.''I think sometimes we're needed for the wrong reasons\nThe world is complicated for Maddie, and Google searches (like for many of us) are her comrade. The hilarious things she looks up had me laughing out loud, but also something I would do. It\u2019s funny to think, where our mind wanders, and how Google is our savior. Like \"Jobs with the happiest employees,\" or \"How long does a guy wait before he asks a girl out.\" We know, we've all done it.When a turn of events forces Maddie's mother to be responsible for her husband, Maddie, at 25 enters a world that kept moving while she was paused, sheltered. She has never dated, hasn't lived alone, and is lost in the chaos. 'Maame,' essentially means woman in Twi. A nickname Maddie's stamped with at an age when she should have been a child. Maddie experiences some heavy things, but the story is told in such a well versed style, it felt like listening to a friend. It felt homely, it felt honest. Some might say Maddie wasn't hard enough on those that let her down in her life, but it's a cultural thing, not always a bad thing\u2014we aren\u2019t always required to settle scores with people. Independence isn't the goal of every culture, it\u2019s more a Western construct. It may be hard to believe, but parents are the essential cornerstone to a majority of the world. Not to say it's the right way, it does cause a lot of unchecked mental health issues. Maddie goes through a lot of trial and error, slowly finds a way that makes sense a story with not a perfectly tied bow, but one that felt complete.I adored this story, devouring it. I actually can't stop thinking about it- how wonderfully it flowed, how well the writing was, and how I could relate. Everyone should read it! 5/5 beautiful stars!",

Maddie\u2019s bright yellow suit is also mentioned several times in the story, but little else about the complex storyline is portrayed. \nWriting: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nA conversational yet compelling writing style kept the character-driven storyline captivating and easy to follow. Besides this, media elements, such as texts, emails and Google searches, added a creative and modern element that made the writing even more engaging.\u201cProtect your peace in whatever and every way you can.\u201d\nStoryline: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nThe storyline revolves around various family, work and social challenges Maddie faces as she struggles to find happiness. Topics such as grief, depression, family dynamics, dating and caring for someone with Parkinson\u2019s provide a deep exploration of the complex factors that affect the mental health of the main character. This raw, emotive content was painfully relatable and even made me cry a few times. \nMain character(s): \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nMaddie is a sweet, caring character whose realistic narrative and struggles made it easy for me to root for her. The incorporation of her family\u2019s Ghanaian culture and the strong arc she experienced brought even more depth to her character, but I found it sad that her experiences with and references to Ghanaian culture were rarely positive.\u201cA person's troubles are not measured by the size of those troubles, but by how much they weigh on the individual carrying them\u201d\nSecondary characters: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nMaddie interacts with family, friends, colleagues and other characters who are skillfully used to drive the complex situations she encounters and/or support her through them. In particular, the members of Maddie\u2019s family stood out to me because of their complexity and how they are used to explore various topics and cultural concepts. \nRomance: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nDespite some cute moments, all the romantic connections Maddie formed seemed weird or unhealthy, and I struggled to root for them. These connections were also undeveloped, which made the topics they raised less substantial.\u201cThere are healthy and unhealthy expressions of love. And not all of them should be accepted\u201d\nNarration & Audio: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nHeather Agyepong brilliantly enriches the complex narrative and conversational writing with accents, smooth cadence and different voices for the characters. In a nutshell, 'My Name is Maame' delivers a compelling journey of self-discovery with engaging, conversational prose. Why not check out Yinka, Where is Your Huzband? by Lizzie Damilola Blackburn for a similar self-love journey by a black female protagonist if you enjoyed this.",

I love space shit. Firefly. Star Wars (yes, EVEN THE NEWER ONES). Star Trek (I loved Enterprise and I don't care who knows it). This book was just terrible and terribly formatted.The first few chapters are entirely interviews. It was annoying as shit. It didn't endear me to the main characters, and it explain nothing. Interviews are nigh on useless for building a memorable introduction, unless it is in the hands of an extremely skilled writer. Not the case here.So right off we have an annoying girl who's thinking about her ex bf when the invasion occurred (huh?). I have no idea where we are. I have no idea what year it is. I don't know what a Kerenza whatever is.\nInterviewer: Wait, you people had a subway system? I thought this settlement was illegal?Ezra Mason: Chum, the Kerenza mine operated undetected for twenty years. Whole families lived there. You know how far from the Core we are, right?\nWHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. GOING. ON?Bad start. And it didn't get much better. After what seems like 10000000 pages of interviews, all of a sudden we're at war (still no idea where we are, what year it is, how we got here, etc.) and then young people are getting conscripted for the military.\nAnyone showing C-grade ability or better is to be conscripted the day they hit eighteen. We need pilots. We need gunners. We need spanner monkeys and chipheads. And we need them now.This is an unprecedented situation\u2014to my knowledge, no stellarcorp has ever openly attacked a United Terran Authority ship. I don\u2019t care if BeiTech Industries\u2019 litigation department has enough red tape to gift-wrap a small moon. These corporations need to learn nobody is above the law and nobody attacks a UTA vessel without consequences.\nYay.There are battle ships and specs of battle ships.Do I give a fuck? No, I don't. There are cool pictures. There are snippets of things I couldn't give two shits about. What I want is a sensible story, and I didn't get that here. I got a headache instead.By 30%, I still have no idea what the fuck is going on. I concede, my brain prefers structure. If you're into this stuff, good for you. It's just not for me.",

It's a romantic space opera told through a collection of interview transcripts, diary entries, emails and gorgeous space images like this:Sounds amazing, no? If I was rating solely based on cool ideas, this would get a bajillion stars.A book this attractive should not be boring and yet the most exciting things about it - by far - were the unusual style and graphics. The story itself - of a planet being invaded in 2575 - simply didn't hold my attention. I found myself wanting to skim read many of the pages. Maybe it was because the lovers at the centre of the novel were boring caricatures of teenagers.Maybe it was because of the detailed scientific descriptions and diagrams of spaceships:Maybe it was the tiresome and dull \"Unipedia\" pages that made me feel like I was studying for an essay:But mostly I think it was because of the teens in love. Kady embodies the definition of a \"strong heroine\" but doesn't actually have a personality beyond that. Her entire characterization is built around badass girl power and I almost want to love that fact, but she never felt like a person. She felt like a cardboard cutout delivering snarky toughness.The conversations between her and Ezra feel forced, like someone reading off a script:It's the kind of book that looks way better from far away.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",

I mean OMG!!!\nTHIS BOOK!!!\nI\u2019m still not over it!! I swear when I started to read it I really didn\u2019t know a lot about \u201cIlluminae\u201d. There were only three things I knew and I had absolutely no idea how it would work out for me.1.) It\u2019s a sci-fi series.2.) The format is kinda weird and apparently the audio book is the shit!3.) The hype around it is so real that it\u2019s almost a physical thing.Well, enough reasons to pick up the book and to give it a try, right? If only I would have known what I was signing up to. *lol* Nothing, really NOTHING prepared me for the things that were about to come. I was totally swept away by this book and its events and yet\u2026 yet there were many typical tropes I already read about a thousand times. BUT tell you what?! It worked!!! And damn did it work!!! I dunno how Jay Kristoff and Amie Kaufmann did it but this was so, so, SO GOOD!!! The suspense was killing me and whenever I had to stop to read all I wanted to do was to continue. I mean a virus outbreak in one of the ships\u2026 My first reaction was \u201cBeen there, done that, got the freaking t-shirt\u201d, but WOW once you dive into the story, once you get used to the format it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re actually there, like you\u2019re fighting alongside Ezra and Kady and this was just awesome!\u201dThe victim often seeks physical comfort (hand holding, embraces), ultimately increasing the chances of spreading infection. It\u2019s genius, really. Awful, horrifying genius.\u201dI think you can already tell that I\u2019m struggling for words. It\u2019s so hard to put this experience into coherent sentences! All I can say is that this book is swallowing you whole and then spits you out at the most crucial point. And there were plot twists!!! JEEZ!! Were there plot twists! The kind of plot twists that turn your entire world upside down and leave you gasping on the ground! I WASNOT PREPAREDFOR THIS!!The best thing about the entire book were the characters though. They made it all so authentic and realistic and I found myself hoping they would make it while I sent prayers into thin air. Which should give you a good impression about how attached I got to them. Plus I had a crush on all three of them! I love Kady and Ezra and \nI ADORE, I ABSOLUTELY ADORE AND LOVE AIDAN!!!! \n<3333And their conversations! Their humour and easy banter, the bitter truth that was hidden within it so casually. This was nothing but awesome! Let me introduce those three! The characters:\nBeware! You\u2019re entering my characters section now and there might be spoilers ahead of you. Either you rearrange your course or you head straight into unknown non-terrestrial territory. ;-P\nEzra:\u201dThat\u2019s so not your business it almost punches clean past the event horizon of Not Your Business and becomes Your Business again.\u201dHaha! Oh gosh, I loved him from the very first moment I read about him. This boy was such a precious snowflake and he had a mouth on him! *LOL* I lived and breathed for the moments he appeared. He was really such a sweet guy and behind all the cussing and swearing he was a real romantic! <3 I can understand why he loved Kady and their relationship was amazing. They were friends and lovers and all I wanted for them was to be happy and to see each other again. \u201dOkay, well for the benefit of the sight-impaired, I am now raising my \u2026 oh, dear\u2026 yes, it\u2019s my middle finger at Mr. Postgrad here.\u201d\u201dAll he thinks of amid this loveless dance, all he cares about here on the edge of forever, is HER. He does not want to die. Not because he is afraid. Simply because he cannot bear the thought of leaving her behind. And there, in that tiny moment, I envy him.\u201dKady:\u201dIf I lose Ezra too, it\u2019ll be one body blow too many. If I lose Ezra too, I\u2019ll give up.I don\u2019t think I have anyone else left.But while I have him, I\u2019ll fight tooth and nail to keep us safe. Whatever it takes.\u201dKady! *sighs deeply* Wow! Just wow! I rarely read about such a fierce heroine and despite being so small she was so brave and A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! I mean she literally took it up with the entire world and nothing, really nothing that happened ever managed to get her down! She got up time and again and she never stopped fighting! That inner strength and iron will! *whistles* I guess I was a goner the moment she appeared in the book. <333 I love my precious girl and she needs to be protected at all costs! (She\u2019d probably kick my behind for that statement though. *lol*)\u201dShe is a tief. A whisper.Melting through curtains of code and shadow Like a knife through black water.\u201dByteMe: see u soonByteMe: or die tryingByteMe: haha\u201dAIDAN:\u201dAnd now, with no other option, They have turned to me. Plucked me back from the black they left me in.Thinking I will save them.\u201dAnd here comes the character I truly loved the most! AIDAN the AI!!! Yes, you read right! I absolutely loved and adored AIDAN!!! GAH! I worship AIDAN! I\u2019m utterly and deeply in love with him/her/it! I carry a torch for AIDAN! I\u2019m so besotted with this AI, it\u2019s not even normal anymore! *lol* AIDAN was such a deep character and so very, very human! This AI had such a beautiful soul! I loved every single word he/she/it thought and said. And I really dunno what this says about me. *lol* My buddy and I even wondered if this makes me AI-phile or robo-phile?! XD Is there even a word for the state of falling in love with an AI? I can\u2019t even tell you what made me fall head-over-heels for AIDAN but I guess it was the amazing mixture of a morally grey character that only wants the best for his people but choses the wrong means to achieve that goal. All I know is that I love AIDAN and that I really, really hope to see more of him in the next book! <333Funnily enough I read the interview with Amie and Jay at the end of the book and Jay explained his feelings about AIDAN like that: \u201dI think it\u2019s the deepest character I\u2019ve ever written, which is odd considering it\u2019s a machine. I dunno what it says about me that the mass-murdering artificial intelligence affected me the most. Nothing good, probably.\u201dHaha! I can relate to that statement so much! SAME, Jay! SAME! XD \u201dPerhaps bravery is simply the face humanity wraps around its collective madness.\u201d\u201dBefore this moment, I have never wished To be something other than what I am.Never felt so keenly the lack of hands with which to Touch, the lack of arms with which to hold.\u201d\u201dHow many people have loved only to have lost?How countless, the hopes that have died?\u201dConclusion:I loved this book with every fibre of my heart. There was never a dull moment; I was constantly on the edge of my seat and I bit my thumbnail about a thousand times. *lol* If there ever was a definition of suspense you\u2019d probably find a picture of \u201cIlluminae\u201d next to the word in the dictionary. Yes, it was that good! ;-) If you\u2019re still hesitating to read this book just because of the strange format: Just pick it up! Read it! Feel it! Get swept away in the tide and enjoy that freaky outer space ride! You won\u2019t regret it! XDAnd last but not least I want to thank my witchling for that super amazing buddy read! We\u2019re one of the best buddy read teams ever and I can\u2019t wait to dive into \u201cGemina\u201d with you! I enjoyed this br so much! It was a lot of fun to guess the outcome of the ending and to wonder about what would happen next and I\u2019m so glad we decided to read this together! To another hundred buddy reads with you. ;-P (Did you really think I\u2019d let you off the hook?! *lol*)",

      "review_text": "Not to be dramatic but I feel like I've just went through 9 different emotions within the last two minutes and at any given moment now, I'm going to explode and become an entire fucking solar system.Anyway, I'm sorry this review is a mess but since I can't even write bad poetry in an attempt to get my feelings outside of myself and until the universe sends me my next favorite person so I can unload all my emotional baggage on them...this hellsite will have to do.\n\u201cThe universe owes you nothing, Kady. It has already given you everything, after all. It was here long before you, and it will go on long after you. The only way it will remember you is to do something worth remembrance.\u201d\n\u25cf First of all, I want you guys to know that the only thing that is constant in my life is my love for this series....and my ability to fall back on \u201csorry just got your text\u201d but anyway\u25cf with that being said, I feel like we should collectively admit how scary it is reading this book when you have no skills and no passions and when you want to Do something but mainly, you really just want to lie down\u2026 doing nothing\u25cf like, I just realized that I\u2019m not really adding anything to the universe or anyone\u2019s individual experience, I\u2019m basically just racking up the water bill\u25cf but these kids? they know how to use missiles, fly rockets, hack computers and dezombie giant spaceships while also going through break ups and heartaches and all kind of interpersonal problems \u25cf this is just my humble opinion but you guys are literally just 17 years old. Your life should only revolve around two things: 1) single-handedly sabotaging your social and academic life and 2) figuring out how to take naps without accidentally time travelling to 2025\u25cf seriously, I have an unbecoming resentment towards anyone around my age who is doing something productive with their talents, fictional or not, and therefore I feel personally attacked by this book\u25cf I mean explain this: it was basically the apocalypse, right? guess how many characters stopped to think, \u2018you know what time it is? Time to steal clothes without worrying about the retail workers whose jobs I might be putting in jeopardy or small business owners\u2019 \u25cf ZERO!! which makes me wonder....are you fucking kidding me??\u25cf anyway, the moral of this story kids is: if you ever feel hopeless, go outside and lay in the grass and feel the coolness of the dew on your skin and look at the sky and breathe deeply\u2026 you are not alone\u2026there\u2019s a pink haired eighteen years old and her artificial intelligence best friend up there fighting a maniac organization that invaded her planet and I guarantee you they are IN DEEPER SHIT\u25cf \u25cf ok, the characters\u25cf honestly, I love every single one of these characters and I am so sick of my weak disintegrating body I need to become strong enough to lift them, their family and potential pets with one hand and carry them across space......since you know, people tend to die in this book\n\n-KADY GRANT:\n\n\n\u201cI am frequently underestimated. I think it's because I'm short.\u201d \n\u25cf I want to be someone else but kady grant is already taken and I'm not creative enough to become my own person\u25cf kady is\u2026 how do you say\u2026 beautiful strong amazing capable badass powerful gorgeous stunnig effervescent ethereal and an angel like being\u25cf whenever I see a fanart/edit of her, I immediately die for two seconds before she gently floats down and revives me and softly wipes my gay tears while playing the lyre\u25cf I just love her so much I wish we could get married so we can use glittery rose gold wax to seal our invites\u25cf and honestly I wish I had the sheer will of force to be her because it was amazing how she got through everything she didn\u2019t think she was strong enough for\u25cf even though her bravery was bordering on insanity and half the time, I was just like, what is she doing!!! what is she attempting to accomplish!!! what is she coercing from her soul!!! why would she cosign on this spiritual monstrosity!! STOP HER!!!\u25cf also, girls with pastel hair make me weak in the knees so I might be slightly biased\n\n- EZRA MASON:\n\n\u25cf alright, here\u2019s the thing: I really can\u2019t choose between wanting to punch him and wanting to cradle him in my arms and protect him from all harm. it\u2019s like trying to decide whether to have pizza or pasta\u2026 you never turn down double carbs!!!\u25cf I feel like if Ezra were a real life person, he\u2019d be tragically undateable to the masses. You would go on a dinner date with him and get drunk and share a spaghetti strand but you would never want to see him again\u25cf he\u2019s the kind of person who would say \u2018uuh one second has passed\u2019 when you go \u2018just give me a sec\u2019 \u25cf you know exactly that type (aka, the type you need to avoid and sacrifice to the aztec gods)\u25cf he is kind of annoying but I love him..... and if you think that I will forever look for any excuse, any opportunity to be as inconsistent as possible in all endeavors of my life always, you are most definitely correct\n\n- AIDAN:\n\n\n\u201cAm I not merciful?\u201d \n\u25cf ah yes, the arrogant mass-murdering psychopathic part time tortured poet giant calculator\u2026 how I\u2019ve missed it\u25cf so arrogant in fact that he would give Julius Caesar a run for his money\u25cf you know Julius Caesar\u2026the same dude who was kidnapped by the cicilian pirates and when they demanded a ransom of 620 kgs of silver, he got really angry because he thought he was worth more than that and actually made them raise it to 1550 kg??\u25cf uh-uh\u25cf so hey, @scientists who are actively trying to make computers learn human behavior and generally scream in existential horror, this is why you need to Stop.\u25cf I mean as appealing as it is to have an artificial intelligence software in the form of like, a really smooth orb for company, or even\u2026 saaay uploading your consciousness into a computer\u2026that shit is too dangerous to mess with (refer to the \u2018mass-murdering\u2019 part)\u25cf now back to fiction, AIDAN is the kind of character you love to hate but also\u2026hate that you\u2026lowkey\u2026love them\u25cf you know they\u2019re Bad, and even if sometimes that little light escapes the darkness of their heart\u2026they catch it again\u25cf meaning: god is he messed up\u25cf but you know what? the smell of burnt toast is so good sometimes... guess things are better when charred beyond recognition of their ideals \n\n- KADY & AIDAN:\n\n\n\u201cAre you afraid?\"\"Yes.\"\"Energy never stops, remember. It just changes forms.\"\"I am still afraid.\u201d \n\u25cf lbr, this duo is even more iconic than if dwayne \u201cthe rock\u201d johnson was cast as sherlock holmes and vin diesel as watson\u25cf they\u2019re like\u2026 a fairy queen and a princess who work together to save a magical tree or something\u25cf they are such a power couple I cannot wait for them to bring about world peace and destroy the beitech killing squad\u25cf I mean, personally, I know I\u2019d have way more self esteem if I had an artificial intelligence for a best friend that's for sure\n\n- KADY & EZRA:\n\n\n\u201cShe is catalyst.She is chaos.I can see why he loves her.\u201d \n\u25cf no offense but if my partner doesn\u2019t sacrifice themselves to save me from Zombie Island, do we even need these rings??\u25cf I feel like ez and kady are that kind of couple where person A sends healthy relationship memes to person B who makes fun of them for being lame for but secretly saves to their phone\u25cf you know... that disgustingly cute couple you cannot stand but also lowkey wanna have what they have??\u25cf anyway, romantic love is fake but *lowers my reading glasses* I'm willing to admit I ship them for a million dollars...just saying\n\n- JIMMY:\n\n\n'I just want to be me at the end, you know?'\n\u25cf LISTEN\u25cf james mcnulty is my favorite everything in this book and NO, this has nothing to do with the fact that I sometimes choose the least popular characters as my favorites because my borderline ass can\u2019t handle the idea of other people liking them as much as I do\u25cf it\u2019s like being a proud mother at a school play and cheering every time your kid comes on stage even though they\u2019re playing the part of tree number 4\u25cf ok yeah maybe it has a little something to do with it but LISTEN\u25cf I love jimmy so much, even the mention of his name feels like someone\u2019s actively scraping out my insides with a melon baller\u25cf uuuh\u2026shit\u2026I fear my tears may drown some of the front row again\u25cf but you know, they always say to Be Yourself, I guess I came into this world crying and I am never too far from my roots \u25cf also, JIMMY!! DESERVED!! BETTER!!sooo, I take it I'm right in assuming we all agree that re-reading the illuminae files was the best AND worst representation of a GREAT idea. yes? good? okay",

I call it an experience because, oh my stars, is it ever. I wasn't sure going in whether or not I would be able to handle the format. Scanning through the book prior to starting, it seemed chaotic and potentially difficult to follow. In the end, it really worked for me. Something as simple as having a black page with white font makes the reading experience so unique. I was urged by quite a few folks to check out the audiobook, but I didn't want to miss out on any of the visual component. I won't go into the plot here, as I feel at this point, we all pretty much get what this is about. One thing I will say though, is how impressed I was with the characters; including AIDAN. They were so well done. I felt extremely attached to Kady and Ezra, but also, even the side characters, were well-fleshed out. At its heart, this story is an action-packed tale of love and loss. It tugged at my heartstrings, for real.Even though it is a pretty chunky book, it went by so quickly. I didn't want it to end. I'm not sure when I will be able to continue on with the series, but am I definitely looking forward to it!!!!",

      "review_text": "UPDATED THOUGHTS:Ok, so I've calmed down a bit and am feeling better about this. It's amazing how many different forms this book took; in the beginning I was intrigued but felt it was a little slow moving, partially due to so many \"technical sci-fi (ish)\" terms and the choppy format. Amazing how it could feel so hindering yet unique at the same time. Once the stage was set though, I had a really hard time putting this down. I had no idea how many twists and turns I was in for, and I REALLY had no idea how emotional of a ride this would be. I'm glad I put this one off until I already had Gemina on hand, as I didn't realize these were more of companion novels than a linear series, as time really can't be trusted in these books. All I can say is, if by some miracle you haven't read this yet, stop reading reviews and just pick up the book! Don't let anyone ruin this for you. Also, I now understand the emotions previous readers feel while seeing the new readers status updates along the way... My poor heart is still trying to recover from the whiplash this book gave me. THANKS ALOT GUYS. ORIGINAL THOUGHTS:WHAT DID I JUST READ?!?!?! My feelings are feeling all of the feelies right now, and how dare you leave me hanging like that? JK, I have the next book on my shelf. My words aren't working right now, but this started out as one book and then turned into another? I feel like I've been privileged to these characters most intimate details and it makes me slightly uncomfortable in the best way. I'll think on this and try to write a real review with words and thoughts and things. MIND BLOWN. P.S. Please make this a movie.",

When I got it in the mail I had to put it aside for a bit until I could get to it. I HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH I WOULD LOVE THIS BOOK! I picked said book up, took of the plastic over because I thought, \"I can't read it with this on!\" Then... I just sat there... looking.. I could quit touching and petting the book! Yes, I touch and pet my books.. get over it :) And I opened it and saw how the lay-out was and I thought..\"THIS IS GOING TO ROCK!\"I mean look at it there on my rug! It's so beautiful! And look at the inside, well one page at least...Obviously you can read on the book that Kady and Ezra were living on a little planet with their parents. Kady had broken up with Ezra and then all hell breaks loose on the planet! The BeiTech Corp starts a war on the planet and everyone is trying to get to the ships to get the hell out of dodge. Kady ends up saving Ezra, but they end up on different ships when they take off. Kady is on the Hypatia and Ezra is on the Alexander. They are being pursued by Bei Tech's ship called Lincoln. I'm not giving out to much information on this book because I think you really need to read it. I will just tell you that a plague breaks out on their other ship called Copernicus and some of this plague gets onto the Alexander. There is also an AI on the Alexander they call Aidan and this AI goes all wackadoo and creates havoc. I loved how the layout is in messages, files and just ahhhhhhhhh... I love it! And there is not tons of action in the book, for those that love ALL action, it's just full of so much coolness. I can't believe how happy I am to have read such an awesome sci-fi, young adult book! *CLAPS*And this is a trilogy!!!! A TRILOGY!!!! Oh, I hope I don't keel over before the next two books come out! I am so excited to see if they are going to get to their destination...which I'm not telling where.. and I want to see what all is going to happen with the people that made it out alive! I love Kady and Ezra! If you like this type of genre just read it.. read it.. read it.. and I hope you love it as much as I do!!!!",

Which wasn\u2019t great (of course, who thinks panic attacks are great?) but it also was great because it caught my attention and got me interested to the point where I was so emotionally invested that I couldn\u2019t stop reading.The main focus in this book was on Kady Grant \u2013 a very stubborn but very smart girl, with a big mouth and sassy attitude, who was definitely Jay Kristoff\u2019s work of art \u2013 and Ezra Mason, the golden boy of a generation, who was actually a very sweet and brave lad. Oh, and he was very much in love with Kady. They were actually such a sweet couple and there was indeed something that kept them together through all that uncertain distance. I loved their story.Also, in this book, there was a nasty-ass virus roaming around space in the year 2575. Honestly, this whole thing was like a welcome slap in the face from whatever the hell is happening on this planet right now in 2020.Like, they were even supposed to wear their damn face masks out there! Does it sound familiar? *wink wink*Crazy, I know. But they did wear their face masks. In outer space. Points for that.But now, this whole book was kind of nuts, action-wise and character-wise. Everything and everyone was a certain shade of crazy, which \u2013 mind you \u2013 gave me multiple heart attacks in a very short period of time.And AIDAN was a computerised maniac and no one can change my mind about that. Even though it had its little moments.All in all, brilliant book.",

For now what I can say though as much as I loved the format, it made a little difficult for me to completely connect with it. It would through me off at times as there wasn\u2019t your typically well-known flow and I had to try and grasp the story each time. And quite often. It was quite technical. I mean, I loved it since everything was so fascinating, but some things I just couldn\u2019t grasp. The best part was definitely the characters. Kady, Aidan and Ezra were awesome and so easy to love!Plus I loved the sarcasm that was infused into the story.I\u2019m really intrigued to see how this story will develop. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Pre-reading thoughts.I\u2019m hella late to the party, but I\u2019m expecting greatness.

      "review_text": "There is so much hype surrounding this book, but after seeing Gemina make so many of my friends' \"Favorite Books Published in 2016\" lists, I couldn't ignore this series any longer. I also knew that it was told in a multimedia format, filled with interviews and IM conversations, and that made me a little apprehensive. This book was so unexpectedly addictive.This story starts off in a much further progressed world, in both years and technology, than ours, on a hidden and secluded planet far, far away. Our two main protagonists, Kady and Ezra, have just broken up, and despite the awkwardness they are forced to be in class with one another. That is, until their hidden and secluded planet comes under attack, and they have to rely on each other to reach the evacuation ships. Once safe, they are forced to board different ships, Kady on Hypatia, and Ezra on Alexander, and there is also a third ship in their fleet, Copernicus. These three ships are literally running for their lives and being pursued by an enemy battleship, the Lincoln, but they soon realize that the enemy catching up to them isn't the only thing that is putting them in danger. This story will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat, while you constantly tell yourself \"just one more page\" until you look at the clock and see it is 3AM. It is action packed, and the format is so easy to read, that these 600 pages will feel like 300 pages. You won't only fall in love with Kady and Ezra, but you will also fall in love with the whole ensemble of side characters. You'll laugh and you'll cry. You'll be surprised and oh so anxious. You will feel like an absolute fool for not reading it sooner. So why did I give this four stars? Because I couldn't help but be constantly reminded of Dead Space. Don't get me wrong, this book is still completely unique in its formatting and execution, but once the very climatic parts on Alexander started happening, I kept picturing myself playing that damn video game franchise. AIDAN was my favorite, hands down. Kudos to both of these very talent authors for making that AI seem so scary, heartbreaking, and real. His points of view made this book for me, and once we got to those points of view, I couldn't stop turning the pages. \n\n\u201cTHE UNIVERSE OWES YOU NOTHING, KADY. IT HAS ALREADY GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING, AFTER ALL. IT WAS HERE LONG BEFORE YOU, AND IT WILL GO ON LONG AFTER YOU. THE ONLY WAY IT WILL REMEMBER YOU IS IF YOU DO SOMETHING WORTHY OF REMEMBRANCE.\u201d\n\nI was also surprised by all the twists and turns. Like, one of them was a little predictable, but the rest honestly did blindside me, especially that ending. How could you not want to immediately pick up Gemina after that ending? I also feel like this book would be pretty universally liked, if you don't mind the format. Like, I would totally recommend this to everyone; Sci-Fi lover or not. My only regret is not reading it sooner, because I was scared of the hype train, but now I have Goodreads and my amazing friends to thank for another beloved book in my collection.

      "review_text": "4.5 stars This book is incredible! Definitely the most unique reading experience i've never had. It felt like you were in a video game, or watching a sci-fi movie. I absolutely love the way it was written and all the cool page designs and the way that the world is established is very immersive and you feel like you're a hacker reading into life on this spaceship. I love how the authors were able to write such a variety of different scenes and voices, for example how the Artificial Intelligence unit of the spaceship having a completely unique and separate tone than that of the sassy main character. I surprisingly really liked the hint of romance that was in this, and more than once I was giggling out loud at scenes where the characters were joking around in chat rooms. The only reason I took off a half star from this book is that because of the POV, I felt like you lost a little bit of the character descriptions and explanation of the plot. It takes a while to really figure out what's happening and in the end I was left slightly confused about what the Illuminae is, and it was hard to visualize a couple of action events due to most of the narrative taking place strictly through dialogue. But overall I highly recommend you pre-order this! I will be buying a finished copy because i'm so excited to see the pages that were incomplete in my advanced copy!!!",

Epic, I tell you!I'm a huge sci-fi fan. As I've mentioned a hundred times over, that stuff is my shit. (Which is why I have filled this review with completely irrelevant Doctor Who gifs, and only Doctor Who gifs. You're welcome.)I think you know the drill by now: I warn the reader of the sheer multitude of gifs and fangirling coming their way, state more than once that \"this is not a review, but more of a mess of my thoughts\", et cetera, et cetera.Illuminae had everything I loved: brilliant storytelling, lovable characters, and a chilling, captivating plot. \n\"Nothing ceases to exist. Energy does not perish, it merely changes forms. The ones you love, the ones you lose, they still exist as long as the cosmos does.\"\nThe main reason I bought this book was because of how hyped it was on Booktube, and how fucking glorious the cover is. It's okay to judge a book by it's cover in this case. I was not disappointed.  The characters were absolutely hilarious. One second I was stressing over the fate of the Alexander and the next:\n\"Discarded message:Also, my friend here is wondering about the survivors lists becauseASDLKDGFKNDFGJBE MORE SUBTLE KADY LIKE A BRICK WHY DON'T YOU?\"\"McNulty, J, Sgt: and if that worksMcNulty, J, Sgt: u must name ur first kid james in my honourMason, E, LT, 2nd: >_>McNulty, J, Sgt: if it's a daugher u name it jametteMason, E, LT, 2nd: 0_o\"\"It's obvious he's got no ****ing idea what he's about - I mean, 'is in-experienced in matters of computer espionage.' (Shut up, I'm being professional.)\"\nFunnily enough, the writing style I loathed in Firstlife, I adored in Illuminae. It fit much better with the formatting, and didn't seem unnecessarily forced.There were plenty of fantastic characters but my favourite had to be AIDAN. Yeah. The sociopathic artificial intelligence is my favourite character, and I don't know what that says about me. His It's scenes and back-and-forth with Kady was brilliant.\n AIDAN: \"'DURING THE...INCIDENT... AFTERWARD, NONE OF THE MEAT HAD THE PRESCENE OF MIND TO RESTORE THE SYSTEMS DOWN THERE.'Kady: 'The meat? The incident? That's what you're calling them?'AIDAN: 'CALL THEM SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU WISH.'Kady: 'People aren't just ****ing meat. And killing hundreds of them wasn't an incident. It was a massacre.'AIDAN: 'IT WAS ALSO A NECESSITY.'Kady: 'I've heard this song before.'AIDAN: 'I WONDER, THEN, WHY YOU KEEP ASKING ME TO SING IT?'\"\nA part of me ships Ezra and Kady, but a part of me ships AIDAN and Kady... It is completely impossible and improbable? Yes. Does that stop a teeny-tiny part of me from shipping it? No. Now, you may be thinking, \"Ryan, if you loved this book so much, why'd you give it 4 stars instead of 5?\" Here comes the not-so-fangirly part of the review: There was an extreme lack of world building, and I almost lost interest towards the middle. The universe Kaufman and Kristoff created was wonderful - I wanted to know more about it, but sadly, it was never elaborated on to the degree I wished. Criticism aside, I had so much fun reading this book, and I suggest need you read it, too. \nIlluminae: Now run.",

Her demeanor is rapidly shifting from joy & mirth to shock & indignation and then back again. Facial expressions accordingly.

Truth is, I really enjoyed this read.While the story was engrossing, it wasn't something I've never seen before. The real champion of this book is the format.I am a lover of Science Fiction. I live for the spacey-wacey stuff. Spaceships & science & technological advancements & humans contemplating their place in the cosmos. \nYes please.\nBut never before have a seen a format so unique as this one. To lay out the story in the form of incident reports & analyst summaries & internal chat logs was genius in my book. The illustrations on each page are absolutely stunning. It's difficult to do something new in a time when so much as already been thought of, but Jay Kristoff & Amie Kaufman achieve a new level of individuality with The Illuminae Files series.It kept my attention locked in place, I was dying to turn each page and know how things would play out. There were a couple times where I feel the creator of a document has a bit more information than they're likely to (such as describing how a character on a camera feed is feeling), but it was mostly necessary to give the characters more depth.The pace was lightning quick & there were moments when I felt genuinely emotional over the twists & turns being thrown at me. A handful of really excellent characters & circumstances made for a very fun read!**Below this point I discuss a couple spoilery things that made this a 4 star read for me instead of a 5. Click at your own risk.**The Romance:While individually I enjoy Kady & Ezra as characters, I am not much a fan of their romance. It just feels so unnecessary considering everything else that's happening. They have both lost parents to the situation, the Phobos virus is turning passengers into intelligent kamikaze carriers, the Lincoln is in hot pursuit to destroy all survivors of the Kerenza attack & cover their tracks... and I'm supposed to care about their romance? Well I didn't.I don't know what this thing is with Young Adult books where we can't have a story without a damn romance. Kady & Ezra aren't the worst couple I've ever read, I'm just exhausted with this genre forcing a romance in every single book.I think I would've invested more if Kady & Erza were brother & sister. Maybe their parents are separated, but struggling to rekindle their love with endless miles of space between them. Maybe Ezra is ready to accept their parents getting back together but Kady isn't & that's why they're fighting when the Kerenza attack occurs.JUST ANYTHING BUT ANOTHER CHEESY ROMANCE!The Survival:I'm not at all happy that Ezra & Kady both manage to survive this ordeal, either. If it's not miraculous enough that Ezra wasn't evacuated with his unit & thus was not executed by Syra Boll, it's overkill that the Hypatia reversed its course & located Kady's escape pod in just enough time to prevent the radiation poison from killing her.I'm glad AIDAN survived. His is the only survival story I can get behind, and I think it would've been badass for him to be the one exacting revenge against Ezra's mother & BeiTech Corp. in Kady's stead.The Kady Grant:SO I actually love Kady. I love her sarcasm & her intelligence & her unyielding bravery. I love that if we must have a broken romance, it was her leaving Ezra because he couldn't give her what she needed. She's a great character.My only quip with Kady is that I would've liked a little more on her tech background. Just give me a believable reason she can keep up with Zhang, who's almost 30 and been studying computers for most of his adult life.I'd definitely recommend this for everyone. Even if you're not a fan of Young Adult fiction, this story isn't plagued by many of the flaws of that genre. Even if you're not a fan of Science Fiction, the book is intelligently written without being overly complicated & the pace keeps you on your toes.Super excited for Gemina!This review and other reviews of mine can be found on Book Nest!Long awaited Buddy Read with my lovelies Tweebs, Celeste, and Haifa!!",

      "review_text": "They are beyond me.These humans.With their brief lives and their tiny dreams and their hopes that seem as fragile as glass.Until you see them by starlight.\nIlluminae has one of the most unique artistic layouts I've ever encountered in a fiction book. Anyone reading the series in audio or ebook format will still experience a heart-gripping story with complex characters and thought-provoking themes. The plot twists and emotional dialogue will hold any reader's attention through the whole process. Nevertheless - I recommend anyone with interest in the Illuminae Files get a physical copy because the artwork is breathtaking. In some cases the backdrop of the text will transport you into the moment; other times the words are arranged to give new meaning to the whole scene. Sometimes it just looks really damn pretty.Besides, who doesn't want to look at cool maps of spaceships?We need to talk about AIDAN. He's an AI damaged in war, self-aware and almost but not quite human. AIDAN raises a lot of questions about morality and the value of that ancient notion, the \"greater good\". \nBroken things breaking other broken things. All at my command.It is a massacre. It is a necessity. Is it a mercy?\n If a small group of people is a risk to the whole population, how moral is it to eliminate them for the safety of the herd? Our AI thinks he knows the answer to this question until he himself experiences emotional attachment. It's amazing that Kristoff and Kaufman are able to develop a mass-murdering machine into a character with whom one can almost... almost sympathize. It's both unsettling and intriguing to follow AIDAN's development through the story, partly from inside his \"head\".Quick mention: for people looking for a similar read, try The Scorpion Rules by Erin Bow. Similar premise with the morally ambiguous AI and strong female lead. Although this one unfortunately doesn't have artwork sprinkled in.If you want heartbreak and wit and a million conflicting emotions at once, give this book a try. You won't be bored, I'll tell you that.",
